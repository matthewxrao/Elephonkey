                    Body = "WASHINGTON (AP) — For much of her life, Angela Crawford considered herself a fairly conservative Republican — and she voted that way. But then a wave of court rulings and Republican-led actions in states restricted abortion and later in vitro fertilization, the very procedure that had helped her conceive her daughter. Now, Crawford, 38, is working to gather signatures in her home state of Missouri for a ballot initiative in the fall that would enshrine access to abortion and other reproductive health care. And she’s voting for Democrats. When Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, Republicans insisted the ruling would mostly affect those seeking abortions to end unwanted pregnancies. But that hasn’t been the case. Women who never intended to end their pregnancies have nearly died because they could not get emergency treatment. Miscarriage care has been delayed. Routine reproductive medical care is drying up in states with strict bans. Fertility treatments were temporarily paused in Alabama. As the fallout grows, so does the opportunity for Democrats. “I wish everyone would realize how big this topic is,” Crawford said of reproductive rights. “People really minimized it initially, because they didn’t realize the scope.” Democratic candidates are increasingly running on the broader reproductive rights issues and they are seeing results. For Biden, who is trying to overcome consistently low approval ratings and Republican Donald Trump’s loyal following in order to win reelection in November, the broader matter of reproductive health is becoming an increasingly potent issue as rights diminish in states such as Indiana, Florida and, soon, Arizona. A Texas woman who went into premature labor, developed sepsis and nearly died because she was unable to get an abortion, and a Louisiana woman who said restrictive laws prevented her from getting miscarriage care are campaigning for Biden in North Carolina. At a Durham community center, blue and red signs with phrases such as “Stop Trump’s Abortion Ban” lined the wall. Doctors attending the event said that helping pregnant patients has become much harder. And tasks they have never had to consider, such as printing out driving instructions to Virginia for patients unable to get an abortion in North Carolina, have become more common. The uncertainty has also motivated Amaia Clayton, a student from Duke University, to get more politically involved. “I mean, I’m 19. I’m in college,” she said. “Reproductive health care is very, very applicable to me right now, and it will be very applicable to me for the foreseeable future.” In Alabama, the pause in IVF services was temporary, but it sent shock waves across the country as other states are weighing laws that could create similar results. Voters have consistently sent strong messages of disapproval over the past two years about restricting abortion rights, and Republicans, including Trump, are struggling to find a satisfying and consistent response. “What we continue to see are more and more extreme positions on this issue, now around contraception and IVF,” said Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez. “And these are policies that voters have continued to reject time and time again.” Support for abortion access drove women to the polls during the 2022 midterm elections, delivering Democrats unexpected success. About two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal, according to polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only about one-quarter say abortion should always be legal and only about 1 in 10 say it should always be illegal. Since the fall of Roe, several states have enacted strict abortion bans or worked to make their laws stricter. In Arizona, the state Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that officials may enforce an 1864 law criminalizing all abortions except when a woman’s life is at stake. When voters have been given the choice, they have approved statewide ballot initiatives to preserve or expand the right to abortion. In a follow-up to the end of Roe, Alabama’s highest court in February ruled that frozen embryos were children, a decision that led to the temporary pause in in vitro fertilization services. Alabama also has one of the strictest abortion bans in the nation. Democrat Marilyn Lands made it a major focal point of her campaign to flip a seat in the Alabama House in a suburban district that, while increasingly politically moderate, had long been held by the GOP. And she won. Two years earlier, she had lost her bid for that seat. Lochrane Chase, 36, of Birmingham, Alabama, had her IVF treatments paused because of the state court’s decision. That changed how she engages with politics. She said she routinely votes for Republicans. But this time, she supported Lands. “The IVF ruling made me realize that the Roe v. Wade decision has set such a dangerous precedent for states who now have the power to make their own rules,” Chase said. Reproductive rights advocates are not surprised. They expected the ripple effects. “Despite all of our knowledge -- and this has been in plain sight — we face a believability gap with the American people,” said Mini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All. It was the same before the fall of Roe, she said. People just did not believe it could happen. Where abortion has been a difficult topic for some more centrist Democrats, including Biden, to talk about, the larger issue of reproductive freedom works. Not just for lawmakers, but also for voters for whom abortion isn’t top of mind. “The beauty of using the freedom framework is that we can talk about a broader set of issues to a broader range of Americans,” Timmaraju said. Biden has said Trump is to blame for the growing medical peril. After the new Arizona ban that is expected to take effect in the next two months, Biden’s campaign sent out an email that read: “Trump did this.” When asked his message to Arizona voters, Biden’s response Wedneday was: “Elect me. I’m in the 20th century ... the 21st century.” Vice President Kamala Harris will be in Arizona on Friday addressing the issue. Republicans are struggling with how to manage the broadening question of abortion and reproductive health after decades of pushing to overturn Roe. Trump, whose judicial nominations as president paved the way for the Supreme Court’s conservative majority decision, has bragged about overturning Roe. But in a video statement on his social media site, he tried to punt the issue back to the states, and on Wednesday, he said the Arizona law goes too far. “It’ll be straightened out and as you know, it’s all about states’ rights,” he said. In Missouri last week, Republican legislators refused to codify language in the state budget that would have stated that nothing in state laws could preclude Medicaid coverage for contraceptives or IVF-related services. State House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, a Democrat who is running for governor, said it was a small way that Republicans could have shown they were supportive of IVF. But the Democrats’ reason for seeking the vote was also political: They wanted voters to see the track record in black and white.",

And no human being should be afraid to go to a shopping mall or baseball field, nightclub or movie theater, concert or college campus. But too many politicians act as if gun violence is just a fact of everyday life. They offer only thoughts and prayers as tragedies unfold, while accepting millions from the National Rifle Association to stand in the way of even the smallest reforms. We must stop pretending that we are powerless to prevent gun violence. That’s why for decades the Democratic Party has put forth policies that would help prevent the carnage that has become all too common in schools and communities across the country. Democrats believe that we can reduce gun violence while respecting the rights of responsible gun owners. We believe we should expand and strengthen background checks for those who want to purchase a firearm – because it shouldn’t be easier to get a gun than a driver’s license. We believe we should ensure that guns don’t fall into the hands of terrorists (whether they be domestic or foreign), domestic abusers, other violent criminals, or those who have shown signs of danger toward themselves or others. And we believe we should treat gun violence as the deadly public health crisis it is.

                    Body = "The economy is not working for the American people. In a matter of weeks, the abject failure of President Trump and his Administration to competently respond to the COVID-19 pandemic erased all the job gains made since the Obama-Biden Administration pulled the country out of the Great Recession, and plunged the economy into recession once more.  President Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in American history from the Obama-Biden Administration, and he squandered it. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump was presiding over a recession in the manufacturing sector, after years of growth in the Obama-Biden Administration. He had the audacity to pay for a permanent tax cut for big business by raising taxes on working families. He launched a reckless trade war with China that cost more than 300,000 American jobs and sent farmers into bankruptcy, decimating the American heartland. He has left our communities vulnerable and exposed to the impacts of climate change, let other countries outpace us in the clean energy revolution America should be leading, and completely failed to fulfill his campaign promise to the American people to invest in rebuilding and modernizing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure.  But our economy was rigged against working families and the middle class even before the novel coronavirus sickened millions and killed more than 150,000 Americans and counting. Working families’ incomes have been largely stagnant for decades, while the cost of basic needs—from housing to health care, higher education to child care—keep rising at precipitous rates. Meanwhile, the rich have been capturing a larger and larger share of the economic pie, with incomes for the top one percent growing five times faster than those of the bottom 90 percent.   America bills itself as the land of opportunity, but intergenerational mobility has plummeted; children born in the United States are less likely to move up the income ladder than those in Canada, Denmark, or the United Kingdom. Women still earn just 82 cents to every dollar men earn, with even greater disparities for women of color. Median incomes are lower and poverty rates are higher for Black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and certain Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, compared to median white households. And there is a persistent, pernicious racial wealth gap that holds millions of Americans back, with the typical white household holding six times more wealth than the typical Latino family and 10 times more wealth than the typical Black family. President Trump’s recession threatens to deepen existing inequities, as Black and Latino workers are less likely to work in jobs that can be done safely from home, less likely to have savings to fall back on, and less likely to be able to access unemployment insurance and other emergency programs electronically.  That’s bad for our economy, bad for our democracy, and bad for the soul of our nation. That is why Democrats commit to forging a new social and economic contract with the American people—a contract that invests in the people and promotes shared prosperity, not one that benefits only big corporations and the wealthiest few. One that affirms housing is a right and not a privilege, and which makes a commitment that no one will be homeless or go hungry in the richest country on earth. A new economic contract that raises wages and restores workers’ rights to organize, join a union, and collectively bargain. One that at last supports working families and the middle class by securing equal pay for women and paid family leave for all. A new economic contract that provides access for all to reliable and affordable banking and financial services. A new social and economic contract that at last grapples honestly with America’s long and ongoing history of racism and disenfranchisement, of segregation and discrimination, and invests instead in building equity and mobility for the people of color who have been left out and left behind for generations.  Democrats stand ready to take immediate, decisive action to pull the economy out of President Trump’s recession by investing in infrastructure, care work, clean energy, and small businesses to put Americans to work in good-paying jobs; shoring up state and local budgets to save jobs and protect public health in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and enacting fundamental reforms to address structural and systemic racism and entrenched income and wealth inequality in our economy and our banking system.",

                    Body = "Our criminal justice system is failing to keep communities safe—and failing to deliver justice. America is the land of the free, and yet more of our people are behind bars, per capita, than anywhere else in the world. Instead of making evidence-based investments in education, jobs, health care, and housing that are proven to keep communities safe and prevent crime from occurring in the first place, our system has criminalized poverty, overpoliced and underserved Black and Latino communities, and cut public services. Instead of offering the incarcerated the opportunity to turn their lives around, our prisons are overcrowded and continue to rely on inhumane methods of punishment. Instead of treating those who have served their time as full citizens upon their return to society, too many of our laws continue to punish the formerly incarcerated, erecting barriers to housing, employment, and voting rights for millions of Americans. Democrats believe we need to overhaul the criminal justice system from top to bottom. Police brutality is a stain on the soul of our nation. It is unacceptable that millions of people in our country have good reason to fear they may lose their lives in a routine traffic stop, or while standing on a street corner, or while playing with a toy in a public park. It is unacceptable that Black parents must have “the talk” with their children, to try to protect them from the very police officers who are supposed to be sworn to protect and serve them. It is unacceptable that more than 1,000 people, a quarter of them Black, have been killed by police every year since 2015. Democrats also recognize that all too often, systematic cuts to public services have left police officers on the front lines of responding to social challenges for which they have not been trained, from homelessness to mental health crises to the opioid epidemic. We can and must do better for our communities. Democrats know we can end the era of mass incarceration and dramatically reduce the number of Americans held in jails and prisons while continuing to reduce crime rates, which have fallen steadily from their peak nearly three decades ago. This is the moment to root out structural and systemic racism in our criminal justice system and our society, and reimagine public safety for the benefit of our people and the character of our country. We must start by preventing people from entering the criminal justice system in the first place. Democrats believe we must break the school-to-prison pipeline that too often relies on arrests and law enforcement to address misbehavior that ought to be handled and deescalated within the school. We support re-issuing federal guidance from the Department of Education and the Department of Justice to prevent the disparate disciplinary treatment of children of color and children with disabilities in school and educational settings. Democrats believe every school should have sufficient funding to employ guidance counselors, social workers, nurses, or school psychologists to help guarantee age-appropriate and racially equitable student disciplinary practices, rather than turning to police to resolve these issues. A growing number of states have recognized it is unjust—and unjustifiable—to punish children and teenagers as harshly as adults. We believe that if you aren’t old enough to drink, you aren’t old enough to be sentenced to life without parole. The federal government will incentivize states to stop incarcerating kids, and develop community-based alternatives to prison and detention centers for youth and invest in after-school programs, community centers, and summer jobs to provide opportunities for young people at risk. And Democrats believe that children who do enter the juvenile justice system should be given a true second chance, including by automatically sealing and expunging juvenile records. Democrats believe we must ensure real accountability for individual and systemic misconduct in our police departments, prevent law enforcement from becoming unnecessarily entangled in the everyday lives of Americans, and reimagine policing for the benefit and safety of the American people. In recent years, some innovative police departments have enacted evidence-based reforms to change their approach by investing in robust training and putting in place—and, even more crucially, enforcing—strong standards governing conflict resolution, de-escalation, and use of force. We must build on these evidence-based approaches and implement them nationwide. Democrats will establish strict national standards governing the use of force, including banning the use of chokeholds and carotid holds and permitting deadly force only when necessary and a last resort to prevent an imminent threat to life. Americans must feel safe when they are asleep in their own homes. We will work to establish “no-knock warrants” standards. The risk of mistakes and unintended consequences is too great. We will require immediate application of these standards to all federal law enforcement agencies and condition federal grants on their adoption at the state and local level. We will require officer training in effective nonviolent tactics, appropriate use of force, implicit bias, and peer intervention, both at the academy and on the job. And we will ban racial and religious profiling in law enforcement. Democrats will support measures to improve training and education for judges, corrections officers, prosecutors, public defenders, and police officers to ensure transgender and gender non-conforming people receive fair and equitable treatment in the criminal justice system. It is past time to end the failed “War on Drugs,” which has imprisoned millions of Americans—disproportionately Black people and Latinos—and hasn’t been effective in reducing drug use. Democrats support policies that will reorient our public safety approach toward prevention, and away from over-policing—including by making evidence-based investments in jobs, housing, education, and the arts that will make our nation fairer, freer, and more prosperous. Democrats will reinvigorate community policing approaches, so officers on the beat better serve the neighborhoods they work in, and make smart investments to incentivize departments to build effective partnerships with social workers and mental health and substance use counselors to help respond to public health challenges. Body cameras are not a panacea, but Democrats believe they can help improve accountability and transparency; we support their continued use and will take steps to improve compliance, require their use in blended federal-local task forces, and promulgate best practices to protect personal privacy. Democrats believe weapons of war have no place on our streets, and will once again limit the sale and transfer of surplus military weapons to domestic law enforcement agencies—a policy President Trump reversed immediately upon taking office. We cannot create trust without holding those in power accountable for their actions. Democrats will reinvigorate pattern-or-practice investigations into police misconduct at the Department of Justice, and strengthen them through new subpoena powers and expanded oversight to address systemic misconduct by prosecutors. Far too often, the law has shielded police officers who stand accused of heinous violations of civil and human rights. Democrats support lowering the intent standard for federally prosecuting law enforcement officials for civil rights violations. We will also act to ensure that victims of federal, state, or local law enforcement abuses of power can seek justice through civil litigation by reining in the doctrine of qualified immunity. The American people deserve access to timely and accurate data on activities supported by their tax dollars, including policing. We will collect and publish data on the use of force in police departments across the country to promote transparency and accountability. To increase transparency and improve federal, state, and local law enforcement hiring practices, Democrats will also establish a national registry of officers who have been found to have abused their power. Democrats also support measures to increase diversity among the ranks of police departments, so our law enforcement agencies look more like the communities they serve. And we will seek increased funding for officer health and well-being in police departments across the country, including for personal safety equipment and mental health services. Substance use disorders are diseases, not crimes. Democrats believe no one should be in prison solely because they use drugs. Democrats will decriminalize marijuana use and reschedule it through executive action on the federal level. We will support legalization of medical marijuana, and believe states should be able to make their own decisions about recreational use. The Justice Department should not launch federal prosecutions of conduct that is legal at the state level. All past criminal convictions for cannabis use should be automatically expunged. And rather than involving the criminal justice system, Democrats support increased use of drug courts, harm reduction interventions, and treatment diversion programs for those struggling with substance use disorders. Poverty is not a crime, and it should not be treated as one. Democrats support eliminating the use of cash bail and believe no one should be imprisoned merely for failing to pay fines or fees, or have their driver’s licenses revoked for unpaid tickets or simple violations. Equal justice under the law should not be contingent on the ability to pay for quality legal representation, which is why we support increasing funding for public defenders and for the Legal Services Corporation. Since 1990, the United States has grown by one-third, the number of cases in federal district courts has increased by 38 percent, federal circuit court filings have risen by 40 percent, and federal cases involving a felony defendant are up 60 percent, but we have not expanded the federal judiciary to reflect this reality in nearly 30 years. Democrats will commit to creating new federal district and circuit judgeships consistent with recommendations from the Judicial Conference. Sentencing decisions should be based on the facts of each case, including the severity of the offense and individuals’ circumstances. Democrats support allowing judges to determine appropriate sentences, which is why we will fight to repeal federal mandatory minimums, incentivize states to do the same, and make all sentencing reductions retroactive so judges can reconsider past cases where their hands were tied. We believe it is long past time to end the federal sentencing disparity between crack and powdered cocaine, which has contributed to the disproportionate imprisonment of people of color. And Democrats continue to support abolishing the death penalty. Our courts should reflect our country. Democrats will appoint people to the bench who are committed to seeing justice be served, and treating each case on its merits. We will nominate and confirm federal judges who have diverse backgrounds and experiences, including as public defenders, legal aid attorneys, and civil rights lawyers. Democrats are proud that the Obama-Biden Administration commuted the sentences of more than 1,700 people serving unjust sentences following thorough review of their individual cases, and we support the continued use of the President’s clemency powers to secure the release of those serving unduly long sentences. We denounce President Trump’s inappropriate use of clemency to help his friends and political cronies avoid justice. We also support establishing an independent clemency board to ensure an appropriate, effective process for using clemency, especially to address systemic racism and other priorities. Private profit should not motivate the provision of vital public services, including in the criminal justice system. Democrats support ending the use of private prisons and private detention centers, and will take steps to eliminate profiteering from diversion programs, commercial bail, electronic monitoring, prison commissaries, and reentry and treatment programs. Democrats believe prisoners should have a meaningful opportunity to challenge wrongful convictions and unconstitutional conditions in prisons. We also believe that too many of our jails and prisons subject people to inhumane treatment, and will work to end practices like solitary confinement for adults and juveniles, ban the use of restraints on pregnant federal inmates, and ban the use of chokeholds and carotid holds. Incarcerated people must not be denied access to vital medical care or unnecessarily exposed to disease, as they have been during the COVID-19 pandemic. And Democrats will pursue a holistic approach to rehabilitation, increasing support for programs that provide educational opportunities, including pursuing college degrees, for those in the criminal justice system, both in prison and upon release. Democrats believe in redemption. We must deepen our commitment to helping those who have served their time re-enter society, earn a good living, and participate in our democracy as the full citizens they are. We support the automatic expungement of certain criminal records for those that have been fully acquitted, wrongfully convicted, or pardoned by the executive. We will aim to ensure access to transitional housing for returning citizens, support expanded access to mental health and substance use treatment, and will stop the practice of reincarcerating people for technical violations of probation or parole. Democrats support federal and state efforts to “ban the box” and will make it easier for returning citizens to access work opportunities through the Job Corps. The formerly incarcerated should not be blocked from exercising their voting rights or accessing public services, including Pell Grants and nutrition assistance, available to other free citizens of the United States. Continuing to punish a person after they have rejoined the community is both cruel and counterproductive.",

                    Body = "Climate change is a global emergency. We have no time to waste in taking action to protect Americans’ lives and futures. The last four years have seen record-breaking storms, devastating wildfires, and historic floods. Urban and rural communities alike have suffered tens of billions of dollars in economic losses. Dams have failed catastrophically in Michigan. Farmers’ crops have been drowned in their fields across the Midwest. Coastal communities from Florida to New Jersey are facing an existential crisis as a result of sea level rise and stronger storms. Thousands of Americans have died. And President Trump still callously and willfully denies the science that explains why so many are suffering. Like so many crises facing the United States, the impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed in our society or our economy. Communities of color, low-income families, and Indigenous communities have long suffered disproportionate and cumulative harm from air pollution, water pollution, and toxic sites. From Flint, Michigan, to the Navajo Nation, to Lowndes County, Alabama, millions of Americans have been denied access to clean, safe drinking water and even the most basic wastewater infrastructure. Pacific Islanders in Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are losing their traditional way of life as sea level rise submerges their homelands. And although the youngest generations of Americans have contributed the least to this calamity, they stand to lose the most as they suffer from the impacts of runaway carbon pollution for decades to come. Democrats believe there is a better way. We can and must build a thriving, equitable, and globally competitive clean energy economy that puts workers and communities first and leaves no one behind. We will help rebuild our economy from the COVID-19 pandemic and President Trump’s recession by mobilizing historic, transformative public and private investments to launch a clean energy revolution. We applaud the organizing efforts of young people, union workers, and communities of color to mobilize voters and make the climate crisis a top priority. As Democrats, we believe the scientists: the window for unprecedented and necessary action is closing, and closing fast. Democrats reject the false choice between growing our economy and combating climate change; we can and must do both at the same time. We will use federal resources and authorities across all agencies to deploy proven clean energy solutions; create millions of family-supporting and union jobs; upgrade and make resilient our energy, water, wastewater, and transportation infrastructure; and develop and manufacture next-generation technologies to address the climate crisis right here in the United States. And we will do all this with an eye to equity, access, benefits, and ownership opportunities for frontline communities—because Democrats believe we must embed environmental justice, economic justice, and climate justice at the heart of our policy and governing agenda. We will take immediate action to reverse the Trump Administration’s dangerous and destructive rollbacks of critical climate and environmental protections. We will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and, on day one, seek higher ambition from nations around the world, putting the United States back in the position of global leadership where we belong. We will restore protections for irreplaceable public lands and waters, from Bears Ears National Monument to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We will follow science and the law by reducing harmful methane and carbon pollution from the energy sector. Democrats will make investments to create millions of family-supporting and union jobs in clean energy generation, energy efficiency, clean transportation, advanced manufacturing, and sustainable agriculture across America. All jobs in the clean energy economy should provide an opportunity to join a union. Democrats will restore and protect workers’ rights to organize and bargain collectively. The clean energy economy must represent the diversity of America. We will invest in the education and training of underrepresented groups, including people of color, low-income Americans, women, veterans, people with disabilities, and unemployed energy workers for jobs in clean energy-related industries, especially union jobs that provide strong opportunities for economic advancement. Democrats will target relevant investments with the goal of delivering 40 percent of the overall benefits to disadvantaged and frontline communities, including in clean energy and energy efficiency; clean transit and transportation; affordable and sustainable housing; remediation and reduction of legacy pollution; and critical clean water infrastructure. Democrats will also mobilize a diverse new generation of young workers through a corps and cohort challenged to conserve our public lands; deliver new clean energy, including to low-income communities and communities of color; and address the changing climate, including through pre-apprenticeship opportunities, joint labor-management registered apprenticeships for training, and direct-hire programs that put good-paying and union jobs within reach for more Americans. Black, Latino, and immigrant workers are often on the front lines of disaster relief work with limited worker protections. Democrats will invest in this critical workforce, supporting the creation of family-supporting and union jobs in disaster response and climate resilience, with strong labor standards and worker protections, including good wages, benefits, access to paid leave, training and advancement opportunities. We agree with scientists and public health experts that the United States—and the world—must achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, and no later than 2050. To reach net-zero emissions as rapidly as possible, Democrats commit to eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 through technology-neutral standards for clean energy and energy efficiency. We will dramatically expand solar and wind energy deployment through community-based and utility-scale systems, including in rural areas. Within five years, we will install 500 million solar panels, including eight million solar roofs and community solar energy systems, and 60,000 wind turbines, and turn American ingenuity into American jobs by leveraging federal policy to manufacture renewable energy solutions in America. Recognizing the urgent need to decarbonize the power sector, our technology-neutral approach is inclusive of all zero-carbon technologies, including hydroelectric power, geothermal, existing and advanced nuclear, and carbon capture and storage. Democrats believe that any clean energy infrastructure project financed with federal support, including through the tax code, should come with robust wage and labor requirements. We will build a modern electric grid by investing in interstate transmission projects and advanced, 21st century grid technologies to power communities with clean electricity, including federal support to build sustainable and resilient energy grids in rural America and in Tribal areas lacking energy infrastructure. We will reduce methane pollution through strong federal standards and targeted support for repairing and replacing aging distribution systems, which will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, including for the same pipefitters, insulators, and other workers who built the systems in the first place and who know best how to protect our communities from methane pollution. Democrats will lower families’ energy bills by making energy-saving upgrades to up to two million low-income households and affordable and public housing units within five years, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and promoting safe, healthy, and efficient homes. We will ensure investments in affordable housing and public housing support both energy efficiency retrofits and construction of new units, to greatly increase the number of energy-efficient homes available to low-income families. We will address barriers and increase funding for programs that enable energy efficiency improvements for low-income families in urban and rural areas, including through the Weatherization Assistance Program and the Rural Utilities Service, and incentivize landlords to make energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades that will reduce their tenants’ energy costs. We will set a bold, national goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030, on the pathway to creating a 100 percent clean building sector. Within five years, we will incentivize tens of billions of dollars in private-sector investment to retrofit four million buildings, including helping local governments save money and cut pollution by weatherizing and upgrading energy systems in hospitals, schools, public housing, and municipal buildings. Democrats will encourage states and cities to adopt energy-efficient building codes, address barriers to energy efficiency upgrades, incentivize the adoption of efficient electric and geothermal pump home heating solutions that can help reduce families’ energy burden, and leverage the federal footprint to model net-zero and 100 percent clean energy building solutions. Democrats affirm California’s statutory authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own emissions standards for cars and trucks. We will immediately convene California and other states with labor, auto industry, and environmental leaders to inform ambitious executive actions that will enable the United States to lead the way in building a clean, 21st century transportation system and stronger domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles powered by high-wage and union jobs. Democrats will move quickly to reestablish strong standards for clean cars and trucks that consider the most recent advances in technology, and accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles in the United States while reclaiming market share for domestically produced vehicles. We will reduce harmful air pollution and protect our children’s health by transitioning the entire fleet of 500,000 school buses to American-made, zero-emission alternatives within five years. We will lead by example in the public sector by transitioning the three million vehicles in the federal, state, and local fleets to zero-emission vehicles. Democrats will additionally support private adoption of affordable low-pollution and zero-emission vehicles by partnering with state and local governments to install at least 500,000 public charging stations from coast to coast. We will increase investments in public transportation, understanding that the United States currently lags behind many other developed countries in the quality and availability of efficient and accessible public transportation. Democrats will aim to provide all Americans in municipalities with 100,000 or more residents with quality public transportation options by making flexible federal investments to upgrade and expand light rail, bus lines, existing transit systems, and pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. Democrats will invest in modernizing our freight infrastructure, including ports, rail, and maritime freight, in order to reduce air and water pollution, improve public health, create jobs, and improve economic competitiveness. Democrats believe we can build the clean energy infrastructure of the future using American-made materials. We will support measures to build a clean, equitable, and globally competitive manufacturing sector, including national Buy Clean and Buy America standards to incentivize production of low-carbon building and construction materials, like steel, cement, and timber, here in the United States. We will apply a carbon adjustment fee at the border to products from countries that fail to live up to their commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, because we won’t let polluters undermine American competitiveness. Democrats will partner with farmers to make the American agriculture sector the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, opening up new sources of income for farmers in the process. We will substantially improve water security and ecological health through conservation, protection, and maintenance of our water infrastructure, including water systems for home, commercial, industrial, and agricultural use. We will expand federal programs to help farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners pursue high-productivity, lower-emission, and regenerative agricultural practices in order to help build more resilient, vibrant, local and regional food systems. We will substantially increase investments in voluntary conservation programs, which generate economic and environmental benefits for farmers and their surrounding communities. We will support healthy coastal communities and marine ecosystems to sustain and enhance our economic well-being, including in the fishing, tourism and clean energy industries. And we will support communities and businesses nationwide in their efforts to build zero-waste and circular economies, including efforts to eliminate plastic waste and food waste. Every American has the right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live without fear of exposure to toxic waste. And all Americans should benefit from the clean energy economy—especially those who have been left out and left behind for generations. Democrats will create an environmental justice fund to make historic investments aimed at eliminating legacy pollution, which disproportionately causes illness and premature death in communities of color, low-income communities, and Indigenous communities. We will protect children’s health by replacing lead service lines and remediating lead paint in homes and schools; remediate Superfund and other contaminated sites; and ensure housing and schools have adequate plumbing and safe wastewater disposal systems. Democrats oppose the Trump Administration’s reckless and scientifically unsound decision to reverse a proposed ban on chlorpyrifos, a potent neurotoxin proven harmful to children and farmworkers. We will invest to help farmers reduce pesticide and chemical fertilizer use. And we will set science-based drinking water standards for emerging contaminants like PFOA and PFAS chemicals and establish aggressive plans for remediating this dangerous pollution. Energy companies should be held responsible for meeting strong standards to protect worker safety, public health, and the environment. Democrats are committed to ensuring tough safeguards in place, including Safe Drinking Water Act provisions, to protect local water supplies. We believe states should not be able to preempt local government decisions about energy production. Democrats will work with affected frontline communities to develop a screening and mapping tool to ensure racial and socioeconomic equity in federal climate, energy, and infrastructure programs and identify areas of high cumulative pollution that threatens residents’ health and safety. We will help reduce heat stress in urban neighborhoods by planting millions of trees. We will support locally-driven economic development and commit to directing a significant portion of clean energy and sustainable infrastructure investments to historically marginalized communities to help create local jobs and reduce energy poverty, install clean energy technologies including community solar, build resilience to climate change impacts, prepare for disasters, expand access to green space and outdoor recreation opportunities, improve public health, and restore ecosystems. Already, the impacts of climate change are being felt in communities across the country, and the American people are paying the price. Democrats commit to reducing climate risks and building back better after disasters and climate-fueled catastrophes in a resilient, green, and just manner. We will empower local communities to become more resilient to the impacts of the climate crisis. We will prioritize disaster preparedness for disproportionately exposed, frontline, and vulnerable communities and those who struggle most to cope, including seniors, low-income families, and people with disabilities, so that they can become more economically resilient to extreme weather events, heat stress, and increases in disease that scientists have connected to climate change. We will rectify the inequities and inefficiencies of disaster response, including transparent and timely reporting and oversight and protections and enforcement of disability rights. Democrats will ensure FEMA has the experienced leadership, staff, and resources necessary to coordinate the federal response to climate change-influenced and other disasters, and is equipped to work in partnership with, and drive federal resources to, state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments to mount a successful emergency response in conjunction with local emergency responders, help communities recover and rebuild, and invest in pre-disaster mitigation and resilience. We will increase support for restoring wetlands, which are critical for protecting communities from sea level rise and storm surge and also act as natural carbon sinks. We will partner with states and local communities to make smart investments to avoid the loss of life and property, prevent flooding, mitigate disaster risks, and adapt to costly, growing climate impacts. Democrats recognize that climate change poses serious risks to the economy and the financial system. We will require public companies to disclose climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. We will hold polluters and corporate executives accountable for intentionally hiding or distorting material information and for affecting the health and safety of workers and communities. Democrats will empower and stand with workers and communities who have put their health and lives on the line and who have been impacted by the changing energy market, including by fighting to protect retirees’ health and pension benefits, shoring up the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, expanding the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to include those harmed by our nation’s nuclear weapons efforts including uranium miners exposed to radiation on the job, and increasing funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission to support locally-driven economic development priorities. We will hold fossil fuel companies accountable for cleaning up abandoned mine lands, oil and gas wells, and industrial sites, so these facilities no longer pollute local environments and can be safely repurposed to support new economic activity, including in the heart of coal country. Democrats will support the most historically far reaching public investments and private sector incentives for research, development, demonstration, and deployment of next-generation technologies, once again making the United States the world’s leader in innovation. We will challenge the best and brightest scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs in the world to pursue breakthrough opportunities in energy storage, heavy-duty trucking and freight solutions, sustainable aviation fuels, and direct air capture and net-negative emissions technologies. We will advance innovative technologies that create cost-effective pathways for industries to decarbonize, including carbon capture and sequestration that permanently stores greenhouse gases and advanced nuclear that eliminates waste associated with conventional nuclear technology, while ensuring environmental justice and other overburdened communities are protected from increases in cumulative pollution. All of these investments will create jobs for blue-collar workers, including in fenceline communities, help decarbonize American industries, and create valuable new exports to help mitigate climate change around the world. America’s national parks and monuments, public lands, and marine protected areas are treasures that should be held in trust for future generations. We will protect these precious places and preserve America’s unspoiled wildernesses for hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping by codifying the roadless rule, and grow America’s outdoor recreation economy, which supports millions of jobs in rural areas. Democrats will immediately reverse the Trump Administration’s harmful rollbacks of protections for national monuments like Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. We support banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, modifying royalties to account for climate costs, and establishing targeted programs to enhance reforestation and develop renewables on federal lands and waters. We will take action to protect wildernesses and waters, and require full, rigorous, and transparent scientific and environmental reviews of any proposed mining projects near national treasures. Democrats will protect wildlife habitats and biodiversity, slow extinction rates, and grow America’s natural carbon sinks by conserving 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030. We support fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund to increase resources for conserving public lands and waters and incentivizing voluntary conservation efforts on private lands, including through private-sector ecosystems markets. And Democrats will ensure America’s public lands and waters reflect the diversity of our country by engaging all Americans in the great outdoors, building a diverse workforce in our land management agencies, and protecting landscapes, marinescapes, and cultural sites that tell the full story of America.",

                    Body = "Democrats are lying to Americans about abortion. They are both dishonest about where Republicans stand on the issue and misrepresenting their own position. Since they intend to make abortion a key issue in the 2024 election, it is important to set the record straight.  Simply put, most Republicans are moving toward where the majority of Americans are, wanting abortion to be legal but limited to the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. For proof, look no further than the stance of former president Donald Trump, who is leading the GOP primary race by a wide margin; he has called Florida’s six-week abortion ban “terrible” and is pushing back against a nationwide law outlawing the procedure.   Democrats, though they deny it, seek to make abortion access available through the entire nine months of pregnancy That is abhorrent.    Vice President Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, told a group of supporters that the 2024 presidential race will be about “Dobbs and democracy”; the White House certainly hopes that will be the case, given their abysmal approval ratings on the economy, immigration, crime and every other matter critical to voters.   Given the outcome of the most recent elections, it makes sense for Democrats to pursue their one winning issue. Axios reports: “After Ohio’s vote Tuesday to protect abortion rights, Democrats are rushing to get similar measures on the ballot next year in key states such as Arizona, Nevada and Florida — partly to boost President Biden and down-ballot Democrats.”  Getting abortion resolutions on ballots in critical swing states would help Democrats turn out young voters who otherwise might not show up and who are now defecting from Joe Biden in droves. The recent New York Times/Siena poll that showed Biden losing to former president Trump in five key swing states also showed Uncle Joe barely ahead with young voters — a group favored him by 26 points in 2020.    Democrats’ crusade on abortion rights may be politically sensible, but it is fueled by deception.    Hakeem Jeffries, minority leader in the House, recently told an MSNBC reporter the GOP wants “to criminalize abortion care … [and] create a society where women have to live in a place with government-mandated pregnancies.”   While there are some GOP candidates who favor outlawing abortion entirely, most are pressing for “safe, legal and rare,” as Bill Clinton once said.   Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, for instance, campaigned on limiting abortion to the first 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. That is the norm in European countries, guided by the moment during gestation when the fetus can feel pain and also by the ever-earlier date when a baby can survive outside the womb. It is the sensible middle ground on abortion, supported by the majority of Americans.  According to Gallup, only 13 percent of Americans think abortion should always be illegal; 51 percent say it should be legal “only under certain circumstances.” The latter position is where Republicans like presidential candidate Nikki Haley and Youngkin are moving.    Importantly, a majority of Americans oppose allowing abortions during the second (55 percent) and third (70 percent) trimesters. Democrats disagree.    In 2021, all 49 Democrats in the Senate voted for H. R. 3755, a bill titled “Women’s Health Protection Act of 2021.” The bill would have passed the Senate but was blocked by Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The New York Times reported at the time that the bill would “enshrine the landmark Roe v. Wade precedent in federal law.” As I pointed out then, the Times did not provide a link to the legislation, perhaps to discourage readers from finding out just exactly what Democrats hoped to achieve.   The legislation was meant to preempt abortion restrictions that might stem from the overturning of Roe v. Wade. It would have allowed abortion up through nine months of pregnancy, when, “in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health.”    The language of the bill is vague about what might constitute a threat to the woman’s health, allowing that determination to be made by any health-care provider including a “physician, certified nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, [or] physician assistant.” In other words, a woman claiming stress or anxiety would not even require the approval of a doctor to abort a baby at eight months.    Does anyone really approve of that? Yes — Democrats do.   The proof is that New York Democrats enacted such a law in 2019. At the time, Cardinal Timothy Dolan wrote a scathing op-ed, blasting the “grisly legislation” that would in effect allow an aborted baby to die — to put it another way, infanticide. Late-term abortions may be rare, but they exist. In 2020, according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute, there were 773 abortions in New York City performed at 21 weeks of gestation or later. Most likely, in many of those cases the fetus would have been able to survive outside the womb.   The liberal media helps Democrats mislead voters about abortion policy. After the recent election in Virginia, Time magazine wrote, “Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin promised he’d use a GOP majority to pass an abortion ban.” In fact, Youngkin promised exactly the opposite. Fending off such dishonest accusations from Democrats, Youngkin told a Wall Street Journal reporter that “questions about whether he would sign further limits were irrelevant because legislative leaders have promised not to send them to his desk.”     Democrats, needless to say, shamelessly lied about Youngkin’s position. One Democrat ad in Virginia claimed women were “facing the death penalty for having an abortion!” Another said a GOP win would put “Women and doctors in jail!” Republicans need to aggressively educate voters about this issue, and show that Democrats are not only out of step with the majority but that they are the abortion extremists  ",

                    Body = "Democrats have fought to achieve universal health care for a century. We are proud to be the party of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. Because of the Obama-Biden Administration and the Affordable Care Act, more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, from heart disease to asthma, are secure in the knowledge that insurance companies can no longer discriminate against them. Women can no longer be charged more than men just because of their gender. And more Americans are able to get health coverage than ever before.  Democrats will keep up the fight until all Americans can access secure, affordable, high-quality health insurance—because as Democrats, we fundamentally believe health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few.  Unfortunately, at every turn, Democrats’ efforts to guarantee health coverage have been met by obstruction and opposition from the Republican Party. It has been Republicans who have embraced junk plans that undermine protections for pre-existing conditions. It was Republican state attorneys general who sued to block Medicaid expansion and Republican governors who refused to extend Medicaid coverage to their citizens, leaving millions of low-income Americans, disproportionately people of color, unable to access health coverage. And in the midst of the worst global pandemic in generations—one that has left more than 150,000 Americans dead and counting—the Trump Administration is fighting in court to invalidate the entirety of the Affordable Care Act and eliminate insurance for tens of millions of people. Overturning the Affordable Care Act remains a central plank of the Republican Party platform. The difference in values between the two parties on this life-or-death issue could not be more stark.  The COVID-19 pandemic has made this difference in values painfully, brutally clear. President Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, bullied governors for enacting life-saving public health measures, and left our frontline health care heroes without the equipment they need to protect themselves and the American people. The burdens of this pandemic have not been borne equally, as communities of color have suffered higher rates of infection and death, and struggled to access life-saving care when they need it most. Our essential workers have been deemed expendable by the President and his Administration.  As Democrats, we say with one voice: no more.  We are going to at last build the health care system the American people have always deserved: one that finally provides universal health care coverage; reduces prescription drug prices, premiums, and out-of-pocket costs; reins in overall health care expenses; and tackles the deep-seated inequities in our health care system. We will build a health care system that is driven by the needs of patients and the people who care for them, instead of the profit motives of corporations. We will tackle entrenched racial disparities in health care, reduce prescription drug prices by standing up to big pharmaceutical companies, and make it easier to access mental health and substance use disorder treatment and long-term services and supports in metropolitan and rural areas alike.  Democrats will always fight to save Americans’ lives by making it easier and more affordable to go to the doctor, get prescription medicines, and access preventive testing and treatments.  Generations of Democrats have been united in the fight for universal health care. We are proud our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and those who support a Medicare for All approach; all are critical to ensuring that health care is a human right.",

                    Body = "WASHINGTON — The calculation behind Republicans’ steadfast opposition to any new gun regulations — even in the face of the kind of unthinkable massacre that occurred Tuesday at an elementary school in Texas — is a fairly simple one for Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Asked Wednesday what the reaction would be from voters back home if he were to support any significant form of gun control, the first-term Republican had a straightforward answer: “Most would probably throw me out of office,” he said. His response helps explain why Republicans have resisted proposals such as the one for universal background checks for gun buyers, despite remarkably broad support from the public for such plans — support that can reach up to 90 percent nationwide in some cases. The reality is that that 90 percent figure probably includes some Republicans who are open to new laws, but would not clamor for them or punish a lawmaker for failing to back them, and the 10 percent opposed reflect the sentiments of the G.O.P. base, which decides primary contests and is zealous in its devotion to gun rights. Most Republicans in the Senate represent deeply conservative states where gun ownership is treated as a sacred privilege enshrined in the Constitution, a privilege not to be infringed upon no matter how much blood is spilled in classrooms and school hallways around the country. “We don’t want to take away the rights of law-abiding citizens,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, explaining why members of his party have no interest in imposing new regulations on gun purchases, even after the murder of 19 children and two teachers, the latest in a seemingly unending series of shooting massacres in the United States. The politics of gun control have always been fraught, and Democrats dodged the issue for decades following their loss of the House in 1994, which many of them attributed to their passage of an assault weapons ban. The epidemic of mass shootings has prompted Democrats to change course, and now even Democrats from red states, such as Jon Tester of Montana, have embraced background checks. But as Republican voters have become more conservative, Republican lawmakers have dug in deeply against any notion that new strictures on gun purchases are an antidote to mass shootings. They say that such restrictions are unconstitutional, even though adult Americans would continue to have easy access to weapons purchases if they became law. Republicans like Mr. Cramer understand that they would receive little political reward for joining the push for laws to limit access to guns, including assault-style weapons. But they know for certain that they would be pounded — and most likely left facing a primary opponent who could cost them their job — for voting for gun safety laws or even voicing support for them. The political threat from any perceived support for gun restrictions was on display just this week in a hotly contested Senate Republican primary race in Alabama. Mike Durant, an Army helicopter pilot once considered a contender for the Senate nomination, was reproached by his opponents for an 11-year-old speech in which he seemed to suggest that disarming an urban population would be a step toward reducing crime. “Mike Durant — dangerously wrong on guns,” said one attack ad. Mr. Durant said his remarks, made at the Army War College, were related to the civil war in Somalia, where he had piloted a helicopter in the famous Black Hawk Down incident, and were being twisted and taken out of context. But the damage was done, and the attack was considered a factor in his finishing third on Tuesday, in a contest whose victor was all but certain to be elected. Such outcomes are not lost on other Republicans. Image Mike Durant, a Republican candidate in Alabama, was criticized by others in his party for seeming to suggest gun control measures in a speech he made a decade ago.Credit...Charity Rachelle for The New York Times\r\nThe scene on Wednesday on Capitol Hill had a wrenching familiarity to it, as Republican lawmakers were mobbed by reporters and pressed on whether they could support something — anything — to curb the ongoing gun violence in the United States. Most who engaged said they were open to discussions, that they were happy to review what was on the table and that maybe, just maybe, some accommodation could be reached. Democrats said they have seen it all before and know how it ends — with nothing. “They are going to rope-a-dope the issue, hope that Congress adjourns, and 10 days from now the furor will once again die down,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. Despite the slim prospects for success, a small group of lawmakers on Thursday began bipartisan talks to try to find common ground on some sort of legislative response. They held out hope that they could agree on initiatives such as so-called red flag laws, which would allow police to seize guns from those who threaten themselves or others. The group was given about two weeks to reach some sort of deal. If they do not, Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, promised that the Senate would still vote on gun control bills. “We’re putting people on the record one way or the other,” he said at a gun-control rally outside the Capitol. “We’re going to have a debate here. We are going to force people to tell America which side they are on.” Other Democrats said they saw nothing from their Republican colleagues that suggested a change in sentiment — particularly with crucial midterms looming — or that would lead them to expect that progress could be made on gun safety, despite Tuesday’s horrendous toll. “They are disturbed, they are troubled, but they are not willing to change where they are,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. While they are mainly opposed to gun safety legislation, Republicans do not want to appear to be nonresponsive in the wake of the shooting. Many voiced support for new mental health programs or for “hardening” the nation’s schools as an alternative to taking action on guns. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, on Wednesday sought to win unanimous Senate agreement to bring up a bill he has written that creates a sort of clearinghouse on best practices for school safety. “There’s nothing partisan about this bill whatsoever,” said Mr. Johnson, a strong proponent of gun rights. “It’s just a good idea that could save lives.” But to Democrats, Mr. Johnson’s idea was far from an appropriate legislative response to what took place this week in Uvalde, or earlier this month in Buffalo, or in 2012 in Newtown, Conn. “The Johnson bill is not in any way, shape or form a sufficient solution,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader. Though the National Rifle Association has recently been diminished by scandal and financial turmoil, Democrats say that the organization still has a strong hold on Republicans through its financial contributions and support, hardening the party’s resistance to any new gun laws. Despite the shooting in the same state, top Republicans are expected to appear this weekend at the group’s convention in Houston. “It is hard to say no to someone, to groups, who are principal suppliers of campaign funding, and that’s where they are trapped,” Mr. Markey said of Republicans. But Mr. Cramer noted that he did not receive the N.R.A. endorsement when he won election in 2019, and argued that most Republicans are representing not the gun-rights group, but the views of constituents who will not tolerate any action that could be seen as clamping down on gun rights. “It is a fundamental right for law-abiding citizens to protect themselves with firearms,” said the senator, who has an “A” grade from the N.R.A. “It is fundamental. It is exactly that. It is constitutional.”",

                    Body = "Republican economic policies focus on what's good for businesses and investors. Republicans say that prosperous companies will boost economic growth for everyone.  Republicans promote supply-side economics. That theory says reducing costs for business, trade, and investment is the best way to increase growth. Investors buy more companies or stocks. Banks increase business lending. Owners invest in their operations and hire workers. These workers spend their wages, driving both demand and economic growth.  Republicans define the American Dream as the right to pursue prosperity without government interference.1 That's achieved by self-discipline, enterprise, saving, and investment by individuals. Warren Harding said, \"Less government in business and more business in government.\"2 Calvin Coolidge said, “The chief business of the American people is business.”3 Herbert Hoover was a strong advocate of laissez-faire economic policies. He believed the free market would self-correct during the Great Depression. He felt that economic assistance would make people stop working. His biggest concern was keeping the budget balanced.4 In his first inaugural address, Ronald Reagan said of the late-1970s inflation, \"In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problems. Government is the problem.\"5  Here is a short list of the pros and cons of some Republican economic policies. Pros\r\nTax cuts spur economic growth during a recession. Deregulation keeps government from stifling entrepreneurial innovation. Spending less on welfare saves money. Tax credits can make healthcare more affordable for individuals. Provides continuing financial support for a strong military (although Democrats do this, too). Until recently, favored free trade agreements to help the U.S. export. Cons\r\nReduce government aid, which forces some to go without essentials. The wealthy pay most of the taxes, so they receive most of the tax-cut benefits. Deregulation allows firms to take on too much risk Increase the national debt (although Democrat policies do this, too). Supply-side economics doesn't work if tax rates are below 50%. Taxes\r\nRepublicans favor tax cuts on businesses and high-income earners. They also promote tax cuts on capital gains and dividends to boost investment. The supply-side theory states that all tax cuts, whether for businesses or workers, spur economic growth. Trickle-down economics argues that the expansion generated by tax cuts is enough to broaden the tax base. In time, the increased revenue from a stronger economy offsets any initial revenue loss from the tax cuts. Republican President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). It cut individual income tax rates, doubled the standard deduction, and eliminated personal exemptions. The top individual tax rate fell to 37%. The corporate tax rate fell from 35% to 21%.6 Trump promised that the cuts would eventually boost growth enough to make up for revenue loss. The Joint Committee on Taxation said the TCJA increases the deficit by $1.1 trillion and will increase growth by 0.7% annually, reducing revenue loss by only $385 billion.7\r\nTax Policy Center. \"How Did the TCJA Affect the Federal Budget Outlook?\" \r\nRegulation\r\nBusiness-friendly fiscal policies include deregulation. Republicans don't want the government to interfere with a free-market economy. An unregulated market allows more innovation in industries from small niche entrepreneurs. Over time, large businesses can gain control of their regulatory agencies. They then can create monopolies. In many cases, regulation is critical in controlling negative externalities, such as pollution, where there is a market failure. This is important in industries that produce pollution but are not charged for the consumption of clean air. In 1999, a Republican-controlled Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. It repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. It had prohibited retail banks from using deposits to fund risky stock market purchases. That soon led to the 2008 financial crisis.8 Social Welfare\r\nRepublicans promise to cut spending on social programs such as welfare. They believe these programs reduce the initiative that drives capitalism. For example, Reagan spoke about the need for welfare reform. He blamed government assistance for causing broken families and making poverty worse.9 President George W. Bush supported a welfare-to-work program. It required welfare recipients to work 40 hours per week.10 Healthcare\r\nRepublicans want to get the government out of providing healthcare. Trump's healthcare policies reflect this by trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA).11 The TCJA eliminated the requirement that all Americans without health insurance must pay a penalty.6 The Trump administration also allowed states to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients.12 The administration did not produce an alternative to the ACA that covered pre-existing conditions. National Security\r\nThe only government spending Republicans won't cut is military spending. They argue that a strong defense is necessary to protect the nation.13 In addition, the Constitution supports the government's role in defense.  The Debt\r\nRepublicans say they believe in fiscal responsibility. But they are just as likely as Democrats to increase the debt. For example, President Barack Obama increased the debt by $8.6 trillion. It was the most, dollar-wise. President George W. Bush was second, adding $5.8 trillion. Although Bush added less, he doubled the debt during his two terms.14 Every Republican president since Calvin Coolidge has added to the debt.  Trade\r\nRepublican presidents were in favor of trade protectionism until the devastating impact of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. President Hoover signed the act to help U.S. industry during the Great Depression. In response, all other countries imposed their own tariffs. Global trade fell 66%, worsening the depression.15 Note\r\nSince the Great Depression, Republicans have been in favor of free trade agreements to help U.S. exporters in the global market. Reagan proposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and it was negotiated under the Bush administration.16 The Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) was signed under the George W. Bush administration.17 President Trump has returned to Hoover-era protectionist trade policies. He pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and imposed tariffs on steel and Chinese imports.18 Does It Work?\r\nRepublicans point to the Reagan administration as an example of how their policies worked. Reaganomics ended the 1980-1982 recession.19 The economy suffered from stagflation, which is both double-digit unemployment and inflation.20 Reagan cut the top tax rate from 70% to 50% in 1982.21 During his administration, the corporate tax rate was cut from 46% to 40%.22 Reagan also used non-Republican policies to end the recession. He increased government spending by 2.5% per year.23 He almost tripled the federal debt. It grew from $998 billion in 1981 to $2.86 trillion in 1989.24 Most of the new spending went to defense.  Note\r\nTrickle-down economics, in its pure form, was never tested under Reagan. It's more likely that massive government spending ended the recession. George W. Bush used tax cuts to end the 2001 recession.25 They ended the recession in November 2001 despite the 9/11 attacks.26 Even though the recession was over, unemployment rose to 6.3% in June 2003.27 In 2003, Bush cut business taxes. It's unclear whether tax cuts or monetary stimulus were what worked. In 2001, the Federal Reserve lowered the fed funds rate from 6% to 1.75%.28 That monetary policy also stimulated the economy. Note\r\nBoth trickle-down and supply-side economists use the Laffer Curve to prove their theories. Economist Arthur Laffer showed how tax cuts provide a powerful multiplication effect. Over time, they create enough growth to replace any lost government revenue. The expanded, prosperous economy provides a larger tax base. Laffer warned that this effect works best when taxes are in the \"Prohibitive Range.\" Otherwise, tax cuts will only lower government revenue without stimulating growth.29 One needs to see both sides of the coin to evaluate which party’s policies are better for economic growth. Find out how Republican presidents have implemented their party's policies and how Democratic presidents have impacted the economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\r\nWhen did the Democratic and Republican parties switch views?\r\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt proposed progressive New Deal measures as Democratic leader. White Southerners began leaving the Democratic Party for the Republican Party. As White Southerners left, Democrats shifted their focus to Black voters, eventually opposing segregation and supporting the Civil Rights movement.3031 What are the Republicans' views on immigration?\r\nIn general, Republicans favor stricter immigration laws and harsher punishments for breaking those rules. In 2021, a group of Republican governors highlighted their points of disagreement with President Joe Biden. They want undocumented immigrants detained indefinitely until their cases are decided, and they call for the immediate deportation of any undocumented immigrant with a criminal conviction. (The Biden Administration prioritized aggravated felons, gang members, and terrorists, rather than all criminal convicts, for deportation.)32",

                    Body = "Health care has risen to the forefront of political issues in recent months, especially in terms of the Republican Party’s opposition to the Affordable Care Act.  In this article we’ll explain the Republican views on health care, the Republican Party’s ideas for health care reform, and important Republican politicians’ views on health care. The Republican Party believes in a patient-centered health care system, which is based in free markets, fostering competition and driving health care costs down. They believe that a health care system that is run by the government will reduce both the efficiency and the standard of care, as well as compromise the patient-physician relationship, and increase waiting periods within the health care system, as evidenced by government-centered health care systems throughout the world. Medical Savings Accounts\r\nRepublicans support the idea of individuals being able to manage their own health care costs through Medical Savings Accounts and Flexible Savings Accounts. Furthermore, they believe that individuals who have Flexible Spending Accounts should be able to roll over their unspent money each year, rather than losing it, and that Medical Savings Accounts should be offered to all workers, with no restrictions, as a permanent fixture within tax law. As a whole, the Republican Party believes that the more freedom the people have in choosing their health care, and their own way of managing their health care costs, the more effectively the entire system will run. \r\nMedicare Reform\r\nRepublicans strongly believe in a reformed Medicare, which will provide seniors with more options. They believe seniors should be offered the same insurance plan that Congress is, including the option of Medical Savings Accounts. The administrative complexities must be reduced within Medicare, they argue, so that providers will be able to financially continue for patients. The Republican Party argues that Medicare should be designed to give older Americans choices, rather than as a one-size-fits-all institution. Tort Reform\r\nIt is believed by the Republican Party that current malpractice laws actually encourage health care providers to conceal simple and innocent mistakes, due to the risk of trial lawyers vilifying these mistakes if they are revealed and taken to court. Republicans argue that a reform in these laws would encourage patient safety, as providers would be more willing to admit mistakes, and therefore patients would be better able to seek appropriate compensation. The most important part of this reform, Republicans believe, would be to open up the flow of information concerning medical errors. Abortion\r\nThe Republican Party believes in an abstinence-only approach to sexual education, as well as educational plans that teach and advocate for healthy relationships. Republicans are strongly against federal funding for abortion, as they view abortion as the destruction of life, and do not believe that the government should be supporting such an action. In relation to HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, they support prevention methods involving early and frequent testing, abstinence, faithfulness, and behavioral changes that will eliminate the risk of exposure. Medical Research\r\nRepublicans support medical research, as long as it does not undermine what they view to be the ethical principles of this country. They strongly support research via adult stem cells and cord blood stem cells, but are against research performed on embryonic stem cells, as this is an unnecessary destruction of life. For the same reason, Republicans oppose human cloning for research purposes. Treating The Terminally Ill\r\nThe party opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide, as well as any non-consensual withholding of treatment for any reason. They believe that health care efforts should instead be focused on research to treat terminally ill patients, as well as pain relief and care of these patients, so that the rest of their lives are more comfortable. Republicans on the Affordable Care Act\r\nIn the 2012 Republican Part Platform, Republicans spoke out against the Affordable Care Act, stating that the Democrats used it more as an assertion of power than they used it to improve health care conditions in this country, and in doing so they detrimentally damaged the health of this nation. The Republican Party views the requirement for United States citizens to purchase health insurance as an attack on the Constitution. They believe that the financial burden it would bring upon the country, and specifically on individual states, through the expansion of Medicaid is unsustainable, and will harm the nation as a whole. The act was so firmly opposed by the Republican Party that not a single Republican voted for the final version that Obama signed into law. Democrats vs. Republicans on Health Care\r\nIn regards to the Affordable Care Act, Republican views have been widely disregarded by the current administration, despite the party’s willingness to discuss options and bring fresh ideas to the table. On December 3rd of 2013, President Obama declared that he “will work with anybody to implement and improve this law effectively. Now, you got good ideas? Bring ‘em to me. Let’s go.” The Republican Study Committee sent Obama a letter, requesting to meet with him to present their ideas to reform the health care laws. To this day, they have received no response. Republicans believe not only in repealing the current administration’s health care laws, but also in replacing them entirely with laws that will better serve the public. The Republican Party’s greatest concern with the Affordable Care Act is the exorbitant amount of money it will cost the American people to implement it, and the risk this cost creates to small businesses in particular. The Republican Study Committee has created the American Health Care Reform Act, which outlines the party’s ideas to reform healthcare in a more effective way. This act would repeal the Affordable Care Act entirely, in order to save tax money and rule out the many unworkable regulations that the act contains. It would lower health care costs by increasing the number of health care options available to both individuals and businesses, which would encourage competition between insurance providers. The act would provide options for individuals to deduct health care costs, reform malpractice laws to better protect patients and reduce the amount spent on lawyers, expand access to Health Savings Accounts, and help guarantee access to insurance by individuals with pre-existing conditions. This act has garnered a good deal of support but, as mentioned above, has not been acknowledged by the President. Other Republicans have also proposed alternatives, which were also ignored. Dr. Tom Price of Georgia introduced the Empowering Patients First Act, which was based on many of the same principles as the Affordable Care Act, but went about implementing them in different ways. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan proposed ways to improve Medicaid for the more vulnerable populations. House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan proposed Medicare reforms which would not only provide seniors with the options that Republicans are advocating for, but would guarantee the continued existence of Medicare for future generations. Another large problem Republicans have with the current health care reform bill are the broken promises contained within it. Americans were promised that they would be able to keep their health care plans if they wanted to, and were later informed that this was not true. They were also told they could keep their doctors if they wanted to, and later found out that they could, but only if they were willing and able to pay more to do so. Republicans see this as a blatant misuse of trust on the part of the administration, and it has caused them to fight against the Affordable Care Act all the more adamantly. George W. Bush on Health Care\r\nDuring his time in office, George W. Bush advocated for HIV/AIDS relief, HIV prevention, and abstinence-only education. He implemented the ABC method of HIV prevention (Abstinence, Be faithful, otherwise use a Condom). He also worked towards HIV relief and prevention through efforts that emphasized regular testing, early diagnosis, ongoing monitoring, and the elimination of HIV/AIDS in newborns. He also increased the amount spent on abstinence-only education. Bush also restricted federal funding for stem cell research (which has since been overturned by President Obama) and created a ban on human cloning and the creation of human embryos that were solely for experimental purposes. During his time in office, he also restored a policy that banned the use of controlled substances for assisted suicide. Mitt Romney on Health Care\r\nRepublican Mitt Romney agrees with the principle that having all citizens insured would benefit the country as a whole, but points out that a government mandate is not the most efficient way to do this. During his time as governor of Massachusetts, Romney created a health insurance program that was incredibly successful, and that he believes could be a good model for national reform. Those who opposed the reform made claims that the reform created uncontrollable costs within Massachusetts, but the Massachusetts Taxpayer Foundation, a non-partisan group, has since deemed these claims a myth. The Foundation’s report stated that the “cost to taxpayers of achieving near universal coverage has been relatively modest and well within initial projections of how much the state would have to spend to implement reform, in part because many of the newly insured have enrolled in employer-sponsored plans at no public expense.” In terms of national health care reform, Romney argues that the government should “center reforms at the state level. Open the door to state plans designed to meet the various needs of their citizens. Before imposing a one-size-fits-all federal program, let the states serve as ‘the laboratories of democracy.’” Romney also supports a utilization of innovations such as electronic medical records to streamline record keeping and make it more efficient to reduce costs. Orrin Hatch, Tom Coburn, and Richard Burr on Health Care\r\nMore recently, senators Orrin Hatch of Utah, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, and Richard Burr of North Carolina have headed up the Republican fight on health care. Their proposal was named the Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility and Empowerment Act, and is based upon the principle of providing more flexibility and purchasing power to the individual. It shares some important similarities with the Affordable Care Act, such as the requirement to allow dependent coverage through the age of 26, and the inability of insurance companies to provide lifetime limits. When the three senators released their proposal, Burr stated “The American people have found out what is in ObamaCare — broken promises in the form of increased health care costs, costly mandates and government bureaucracy. We can lower costs and expand access to quality coverage and care by empowering individuals and their families to make their own health care decisions, rather than empowering the government to make those decisions for them.” The group stated that their proposal is designed to be “roughly budget neutral” over the first 10 years, leaving the financial burden on the American people at nothing. Coburn commented that they created this proposal because “It’s critical we chart another path forward. Our health care system wasn’t working well before ObamaCare and it is worse after ObamaCare.”",

                    Body = "Republican views on education involve a variety of overarching ideas. First, republicans believe in a restructuring of higher education, which would leave more students equipped for their desired fields and less working minimum wage jobs that are irrelevant to their education. Next, they believe in limiting the federal government in education. This includes getting rid of federal student loans, and having only private loans. Republicans also support school choice and home schooling programs. Overall, Republicans believe strongly in an educational system that will provide higher education to those whose achievements deserve it, and that will give students the environment they want and need to succeed both in and beyond higher education. Republicans also support initiatives that increase benefits to students who are taking more difficult courses, form partnerships with colleges and universities in an effort to improve science and math programs, and attract math, science, and engineering students to attend lower-income schools. Republicans support abstinence education when it comes to sex-education, believing this is the only sure way of preventing unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. They believe all family planning education programs should be replaced with abstinence programs. Republicans also believe in an “English First” approach to education, believing programs that divide students whose first language is not English prevents them from becoming accustomed to mainstream American classrooms and culture, and therefore limits their ability to advance in society. Most of all, republicans believe that a students educational opportunities need to depend on their talent and motivation as a student, and not where they live or their income level. Restructuring Higher Education\r\nThe 2012 Republican Party Platform states that republicans support getting “back to the basics” of education, and better preparing students to do what it is they are seeking a career in. At this time, 50% of recent college graduates were either unemployed, or working jobs that were not in their field and for which their educations had provided them no training. The party believes that this signifies that our current higher educational system is in great need of reform, as it is not providing students with the opportunities they are pursuing. Republicans believe that expanding community college programs, technical institutions, private training schools, online universities, life-long learning, and work-based learning in the private sector, to create competition for four-year schools, is a good way to not only make worthwhile education more accessible now, but to motivate four-year schools to match these alternatives’ costs and levels of job-preparedness. They also believe that public policy should address these alternatives, and both support them and make them accessible to all. Another initiative that republicans support to better higher education is to increase access to higher education savings accounts. This will make it easier for any child to attend a higher education program, whether they choose a four-year school or an alternative program. Republicans recognize that many higher education problems arise from poor preparation at the lower educational levels, and therefore support state-led initiatives to improve K-12 schooling. Federal Government in Education\r\nThe Republican Party believes in doing away entirely with federal loans. College tuition, and its consequential debt, is rising uncontrollably. At this point, it is rising far above the rate of inflation. College debt in America, as of 2012, had exceeded the amount of credit card debt. Republicans believe federal loans exacerbate this problem by their lack of transparency, and the fact that they are often more expensive than private loans. For these reasons, republicans believe that the federal government should no longer issue student loans. Greater private sector participation in loans would drive tuition costs down. The party believes that the federal government should, however, serve as an insurance guarantor for private sector loans. Aside from limiting its role in loans, republicans also seek to further limit the federal government’s role in education. In fact, there are some Republicans who believe in doing away with the Department of Education entirely. The Republican Party prerogatives on reducing federal involvement in education were outlined in a set of education reforms proposed by George Bush in 2000. Republicans proposed to shrink federal programs into five grants, allow federal money to be used at the school of a child’s choice, expand school choice by increasing the number of charter schools available, expand education savings accounts, let children in dangerous schools transfer to safer schools which will prosecute offenders, and ensure that all children learn to read by reforming Head Start, as well as by facilitating state reading initiatives. These efforts, republicans believe, will put children’s education less into the hands of the government, and more into the hands of parents and teachers, who have a better first-hand view of what is best for each individual child. They do not believe in a one-size-fits-all approach to education, but rather an approach that is personalized by those closest to the child for the child. The Republican Party disagrees with an approach to education reforms that involves simply throwing money at the problem. The United States spends an average of $10,000 a year per pupil in public schools, which totals about $550 billion. Obviously funding cannot fix the problems in our educational system. Throwing money at the problem will not work. What does work, republicans believe, is accountability on the part of administrators, parents, and teachers (through merit pay for teachers, which increases both motivation and accountability to do a good job), programs that develop the character and financial literacy of students, rigorous assessments of students’ abilities in fundamental areas of learning, and schools that have the flexibility and freedom to adapt to the needs of their students. Focusing on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) subjects, and proper implementation of technology in the classroom. They believe that educational reforms at the state level tend to be far more based on proven success than those at the federal level, and therefore support these initiatives over federal reform. They believe that Republican governors have led the country’s education initiatives over the last few years, and applaud their efforts, as well as encourage others to follow them.",

I’ve traveled back in time from the year 2050. And I am here to tell you, the future of health care reform is awesome. 1 When I presented these observations at a Willamette University College of Law symposium in 2015, 2 I was tickled by how many people I saw using iPhones. I mean, iPhones! How quaint. Don’t get me wrong. We have iPhones in the future. Mostly they’re on display in museums as historical relics or used as a medium for artists. Hipsters—yes, we still have hipsters—wouldn’t even know how to use an iPhone and will sometimes wear them as fashion accessories. Other than that, iPhones can be found propping up wobbly restaurant tables. I also noticed you’re still operating general hospitals—in 2020! Again, how quaint. Here are answers to a few questions people always ask me about the year 2050: • Justin Bieber crashed pretty hard. He is bald, broke, overweight, and has gone home to Canada where taxpayers must now pay for his diabetes care. 4 • Skynet is not self-​aware. At least, not yet. (Fingers crossed!) 5 • The arc of history is long, but it continues to bend toward justice, equality, freedom, peace, and progress. 6 • Mortality from war and disease has continued the erratic but substantial long-​term decline that you have already begun to see in your lifetimes. 7 • Billions of people across the globe have been lifted out of poverty and saved from hunger and disease because we continue to find new, better, and cheaper ways of meeting basic human needs. 8 • Finally—and I cannot overemphasize this fact—we have more excellent water slides than any other planet we communicate with. 9 Nowhere has this progress been more astounding and rapid than in health care. HEALTH CARE IS EASIER\r\nIn the future, medicine is still complex. But health care is simpler. Just about every health plan and provider network offers each patient a personal concierge who is equal parts counselor, clinician, and financial adviser. Your concierge helps you communicate with your medical team, helps you understand your treatment options, and even acts as a cost-​sharing consultant. As a patient, you understand how much you’re going to pay before you choose a treatment plan. Patients can communicate with their concierges—or, if they want, with their doctors, health coaches, dieticians, geneticists, and health plans—in a variety of electronic ways. Alternatively, patients can consult diagnostic software on their own—human attention when you want it, technology when you don’t. It’s easier to see the doctor, or even to get your teeth cleaned. Often, you don’t have to leave home. Telemedicine is a huge part of health care delivery. 10 We keep people out of waiting rooms and hospitals thanks to a revolution that began with, of all things, a car service. I think you called its first generation “Uber.” 11 If you need a doctor, even a specialist, your concierge can schedule a house call, or you can summon one yourself, at a time convenient for you. Your specialist not only comes prepared with your entire, accurate medical history but can perform an increasing number of diagnostic tests and even procedures in your own home. 12 Not everyone uses a concierge or health apps or the other cool stuff that we have and you don’t. Just as some people like to homeschool their kids, brew their own beer, raise their own chickens, and build their own log cabins, others still prefer the complexity of pure indemnity insurance, finding their own specialists, and researching their own treatment options. That choice is still there. But generally speaking, grandparents frighten—okay, bore—their kids and grandkids with horror stories about when they had to carry all their medical records and all their prescriptions to all their doctors’ offices, trying to remember allthe often-​conflicting things each doctor told them. That’s what everyone expected. That was normal. The kids and grandkids just shake their heads. They have health care providers who know their names, their needs, and their values. They have a single point of contact who coordinates all that complexity, so they can focus on what is important to them. That’s the new normal. HEALTH CARE IS BETTER\r\nSimplifying the patient experience and coordinating care has led to greater treatment compliance, fewer medical errors, and even fewer misdiagnoses. 13 Initially, there was a lot of resistance to letting nonphysician clinicians, assisted by diagnostic software, make diagnoses that government regulation previously allowed only physicians to make. But that resistance—which came exclusively from physician groups, which benefited financially—became farcical when the software reached the point where the nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and registered nurses started getting the diagnoses right more often (and at a lower cost) than the MDs. People with less education, aided by technology, started outperforming people with more education. 14 Health care prices plummeted, and thank God they did. In the future, we also have more new treatments and total cures. I hate to depress you, dear readers, but some of you are going to die from diseases that no longer cause death in the future. Some of those diseases have cures. Other once-​fatal illnesses are now managed as chronic conditions. Many once-​difficult chronic conditions are now as easy to manage as clipping your fingernails.",

After crafting a short note to her partner that read “I’m sorry I love you,” Nathan went to the Tree of Life in Audubon Park in New Orleans and took her own life. Her purchase that day ended a decades-long battle with depression and bipolar disorder that had intensified in the final year of Nathan’s life. The Wall Street Journal reports she had voluntarily admitted herself for psychiatric treatment three times in the last six months of her life after experiencing suicidal thoughts. “Each time, she willingly accepted the limitations on liberty that come with a psychiatric hospitalization in exchange for safety and the prospect of improvement,” Yale law professors Fredrick Vars and Ian Ayres write in the Journal. “What she could not limit, under Louisiana law, was her ability to quickly purchase a gun.” Nathan was one of 48,344 Americans who died by suicide in 2018. About half of those deaths were from firearms, which are used in 23,000 suicides each year, on average. It’s no secret that suicides account for the vast majority of gun deaths in the US. Though mass shootings receive the most attention, they account for less than one percent of gun deaths in America. Suicide by firearm, on the other hand, accounts for 60 percent of gun deaths in the US.",

Numerous factors have been at play, but arguably the most potent has been fear: fear that some people might not be strongly attached to the state, or sufficiently moral, or economically competitive, or that they might just be too different. It has often been fear harbored by political elites—but sometimes by large swaths of the population—that has brought us to this very unlibertarian of places. Some members of the Founding generation were among the earliest advocates of government-​run schooling. And the fear many seemed to have was not totally irrational, though it caused them to propose schooling at odds with the liberty at the heart of their new nation. Creating a country in which the people would be sovereign was a bold leap, and many of the Founders had serious worries about letting “the people” control the levers of government. The new country was also composed of states that were often more likely to elicit popular allegiance than the federation they created. That some would want an education system geared toward enlightening the people to inoculate against bad government, and to foster attachment to the new country, was understandable. Benjamin Rush—a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, the surgeon general of the Continental army, and a very prominent Pennsylvanian—was perhaps the most direct in stating his desire to use public schooling to manage freedom. As he wrote in his “Thoughts upon the Mode of Education Proper in a Republic,” “Our schools of learning, by producing one general and uniform system of education, will render the mass of the people more homogeneous and thereby fit them more easily for uniform and peaceable government.”1 He went on, “Our country includes family, friends, and property, and should be preferred to them all… . Let our pupil be taught that he does not belong to himself, but that he is public property.”2 Noah Webster—of speller and dictionary fame—called for public schooling that would inculcate attachment to the new nation, right down to teaching distinctly American—and phonetically more logical—spellings for English words: no u in “color” or k in “music.” He wrote: “Americans, unshackle your minds and act like independent beings. You have been children long enough, subject to the control and subservient to the interest of a haughty parent. You have now an interest of your own to augment and defend: you have an empire to raise and support by your exertions and a national character to establish and extend by your wisdom and virtues.”3 Webster was very successful in spreading his American spellings, but not primarily through the public schooling that he desired. No, he was successful through millions of people independently buying his wildly popular spellers. The fear of difference—especially moral difference—even more than of weak attachment to the country, fueled public schooling. Almost all well-​known early advocates for public schooling emphasized a need for a virtuous citizenry in a country in which the people ruled, and such virtue was roughly defined as holding elite, broadly Protestant values. Rush, Webster, George Washington, and many others emphasized the necessity of virtue. It was also a major theme for Horace Mann, the first secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education and the “Father of the Common School.” Mann was a member of the Boston elite who in the 1830s and 1840s became the nation’s leading crusader for free, uniform, government schools. Reading his voluminous writings advocating for common schools, one clearly sees that Mann thought that far too many parents were dangerously ignorant of proper child rearing and were morally ungrounded. Some of the impetus for that thinking was the arrival of many rural New Englanders into cities as industrialization burgeoned in the region. Mann seemed to perceive them as bumpkins and critiqued everything from their plugging up what he thought were valuable drafts in children’s bed chambers to their ignorance of phrenology, the belief that the bumps of one’s skull revealed crucial information about one’s mental condition.4 He also saw base desires running rampant that perpetuated such evils as the lottery, which he said “cankers the morals of entire classes of the people.”5 Lotteries, he declared, “await the dawning of that general enlightenment which common schools could so rapidly give, to be banished from the country forever.” (Today, of course, many states justify lotteries in part by directing some proceeds to public schools.) Mann asserted that by teaching a sort of pan-​Protestant morality and overriding the foolishness of parents, the common schools would create “more far-​seeing intelligence, and a purer morality, than has ever existed among communities of men.”6 As time went on, fear of disunity and dissimilarity became even more powerful as waves of people not of the Anglo-​Saxon, Protestant mold arrived, including Germans, Irish Catholics, immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, and Mexicans and Asians. Confronted by such demographic upheaval, public schooling’s reach was expanded and control increasingly centralized.",

                    Body = "The stubborn appeal of the libertarian idea persists, despite mountains of evidence that the free market is neither efficient, nor fair, nor free from periodic catastrophe. In an Adam Smith world, the interplay of supply and demand yields a price that signals producers what to make and investors where to put their capital. The more that government interferes with this sublime discipline, the more bureaucrats deflect the market from its true path. But in the world where we actually live, markets do not produce the \"right\" price. There are many small examples of this failure, but also three immense ones that should have discredited the libertarian premise by now. Global climate change is the most momentous. The price of carbon-based energy is \"correct\"-it reflects what consumers will pay and what producers can supply-if you leave out the fact that carbon is destroying a livable planet. Markets are not competent to price this problem. Only governments can do that. In formal economics, this anomaly is described by the bloodless word \"externality\"-meaning costs (or benefits) external to the immediate transaction. Libertarian economists treat externalities as minor exceptions. The other great catastrophe of our time is the financial collapse. Supposedly self-regulating markets could not discern that the securities created by financial engineers were toxic. Markets were not competent to adjust prices accordingly. The details of the bonds were opaque; they were designed to enrich middlemen; the securities were subject to investor herd-instincts; and their prices were prone to crash once a wave of panic-selling hit. Only government could provide regulations against fraudulent or deceptive financial products, as it did to good effect until the regulatory process became corrupted beginning in the 1970s. Deregulation arguably created small efficiencies by steering capital to suitable uses-but any such gains were obliterated many times over by the more than $10 trillion of GDP lost in the 2008 crash. A third grotesque case of market failure is the income distribution. In the period between about 1935 and 1980, America became steadily more equal. This just happened to be the period of our most sustained economic growth. In that era, more than two-thirds of all the income gains were captured by the bottom 90 percent, and the bottom half actually gained income at a slightly higher rate than the top half. By contrast, in the period between 1997 and 2012, the top 10 percent captured more than 100 percent of all the income gains. The bottom 90 percent lost an average of nearly $3,000 per household. The reason for this drastic disjuncture is that in the earlier period, public policy anchored in a solid popular politics kept the market in check. Strong labor institutions made sure working families captured their share of productivity gains. Regulations limited monopolies. Government played a far more direct role in the economy via public investment, which in turn stimulated innovation. The financial part of the economy was well controlled. All of this meant more income for the middle and the bottom and less rapacity at the top. Clearly, a more equal economy performed better than a more unequal one. Families with decent incomes could recycle that purchasing power back into the economy. Well-regulated financial institutions could do their job of supplying investment capital to the real economy rather than enriching their own executives with speculative schemes-ones that left the rest of the society to take the loss when the wise guys were long gone. In the case of labor, there was not a single, \"accurate,\" market-determined wage for each job, but a wide range of possible wages and social bargains that would attract competent workers and steadily increase the economy's productivity.",

The free market, when it is allowed to do so, provides tremendous opportunity for people of all backgrounds, interests, and abilities. Crony capitalism, however, benefits the wealthy, powerful, and special interests who know how to influence policy makers. Libertarians default towards freedom in all things, including economics. When people are allowed to run their businesses the way they see fit, without inappropriate government interference and meddling, those businesses are able to innovate and create tremendous value for consumers and more jobs for employees. Libertarians believe that the only proper role of government in the economic realm is to protect property rights, adjudicate disputes, and provide a legal framework in which voluntary trade is protected. Unfortunately, the vast majority of regulations on the books do not do that. These regulations are heavy burdens on businesses and people who are just trying to make a living, and often prevent new businesses from starting, prevent existing businesses from hiring new employees, and even force businesses to close. This violates the rights of people to engage in peaceful and honest trade. Additionally, it actively hurts people by stifling human energy, innovation, and well-being. Libertarians believe that taxes have the same effect as over-reaching regulations and are a confiscation of the property of other people. Libertarians advocate reducing and eliminating taxes whenever possible to free people and businesses to do what they do best, so that everyone can have a chance to succeed.

                    Body = "Surprising no one in the wake of the leaked draft opinion, the Supreme Court today overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and held that there is no constitutional right to elective abortion access. Some will celebrate that decision for returning one of the most contentious policy issues in American life to the legislative branch, while others will denounce it as a repudiation of personal autonomy and a further example of the judiciary’s historic failure to afford coequal legal status to women. Cato did not file an amicus brief in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization because we believed—and continue to believe—that reasonable libertarians can disagree about whether the Constitution, properly understood, has anything to say about abortion and if so, what. In this post, we will explain why libertarian ideology does not supply a clear answer to the moral question of abortion, why the constitutional question is not as straightforward as absolutists on either side contend, and what lessons we can draw from the majority opinion in Dobbs. I. Libertarianism tolerates a wide range of views on the policy question of abortion access Libertarianism, in the most general sense, is the political philosophy that holds individual liberty as the central political value. It is a broad concept without rigid boundaries, but those who embrace its tenets hold that people should be presumptively free to make choices about their own life and that what people do with their bodies and their property is up to them, provided only they do not cause harm to non‐​consenting parties. Thus, any claim of authority to infringe upon this domain of individual liberty—whether made by a government or a private party—necessarily requires strong justification. From this perspective, it is hardly surprising that state regulation of abortion access is a grave concern for many libertarians. If bodily autonomy entails the right to decide, for example, what food to eat, whether to use drugs, and what medical treatments to accept or refuse, then it surely entails the right to reproductive liberty as well. There are few decisions more intimately personal than deciding whether to have a child, and few developments with greater consequence for one’s life and body than pregnancy and childbirth. Moreover, there is ample reason to doubt the efficacy of state attempts to control an activity that a huge number of people are determined to engage in regardless. Alcohol and drug prohibition appear to do little to discourage most people from consuming drugs and alcohol; but they certainly do set the stage for black markets that empower criminal organizations, reduce safety for consumers, and entangle otherwise law‐​abiding citizens in the many pathologies of the criminal‐​justice system. Abortion prohibition, whatever its merits in principle, will certainly entail some or all of these problems and will, like all prohibitory policies, inevitably raise the question, “How much violence are we prepared to employ against people who disagree with this policy in order to enforce it?” For these and other reasons, a clear majority of self‐​professed libertarians describe themselves as “pro‐​choice.” But of course, abortion access is, at least debatably, not solely a question of personal bodily autonomy. The heart of the “pro‐​life” position is that unborn children—at some point during pregnancy, and perhaps as early as conception—become distinct rights‐​bearing entities entitled to moral consideration for their own sake. To those who start with such premises, “my body, my choice” is no more persuasive an argument than “my property, my choice” would have been to an abolitionist. Both slogans beg the relevant question, because whether it is just the pregnant woman’s body (or just the slaveowner’s property) is the precise issue under debate. To be sure, there are many sensible arguments for holding that fetuses are not entitled to the same quasi‐​deontological moral consideration that other members of a polity are entitled to—for example, that they lack the sort of reflective self‐​awareness that gives someone an independent sense of their own self and their future. Or that, at early stages of pregnancy, they lack the capacity to feel pain. Or that even granting that a fetus has a right to life, that doesn’t give it a right over the woman’s body. The point of this particular discussion isn’t to resolve these debates. Rather, it’s to illustrate that these are questions of moral philosophy. And libertarianism is, fundamentally, a political philosophy that can arise out of many different ethical traditions (consequentialism, natural rights, common‐​sense moral intuitions, etc.). Thus, even if libertarians were in complete accord on the state’s practical obligation to rights‐​bearing entities, they might still disagree on what makes something a rights‐​bearing entity in the first place. What of living humans with brain damage that prevents them from achieving conscious awareness? Or the higher animals outside our political community, which nevertheless demonstrate signs of true self‐​awareness? Or animals that, even if lacking a higher sort of consciousness, nevertheless have the capacity to suffer? Or, more speculatively, computer‐​emulated human brains? There is a not an obvious “libertarian position” on any of these questions because libertarianism does not purport to be a complete theory of personhood and moral obligations. Thus, it is hardly surprising that libertarians disagree on abortion, not because of fundamental differences in (or compromises with) their general political philosophy, but because of different views on what sort of moral consideration is due to fetal life. Of course, the fact that libertarians can reasonably disagree on this issue doesn’t mean individual libertarians should refuse to take a position, and the fact that there are reasonable arguments on both sides doesn’t mean that the issue is incapable of resolution. But we do not think Cato, as an institution, should attempt to offer a definitive answer to a moral question dividing libertarians generally, as well as Cato scholars and staff specifically. II. Libertarian legal theory and the constitutional status of abortion Granting that libertarians might have different views about abortion rights as a policy matter, is there nevertheless a clearly correct position for libertarians to take regarding the constitutional status of abortion? To be sure, there is nothing inconsistent with a libertarian supporting abortion rights as a policy matter but opposing the Court’s abortion jurisprudence as a legal matter. Indeed, many libertarians in fact hold that precise view. But we believe the constitutional question is also one about which reasonable libertarians can disagree and that aspects of it may well be as difficult as the intractable disagreements among leading lawyers, judges, and scholars suggest that it is—especially given that courts had recognized a constitutional right to abortion access for half a century. Most libertarians start with a shared set of beliefs about determining what rights the Constitution does and does not protect. First, human beings possess certain “unalienable” natural rights that are neither conferred by nor dependent upon any legal charter, including the Constitution. Second, the U.S. Constitution neither lists nor purports to list all of the distinct legally enforceable rights that people possess. To the contrary, libertarians recognize and give force to the many provisions of the Constitution that provide explicit textual support for protecting that broader category of liberty often labelled, perhaps misleadingly, “unenumerated rights”—most obviously, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities Clause. Uncontroversial examples of so‐​called “unenumerated rights” include the freedom to travel around the country (nowhere explicitly mentioned in the text of the Constitution but never seriously questioned), the ability to direct the upbringing of one’s children, and the right to defend oneself against violent and unjustified attack. The Supreme Court has also held, in a decision that even most self‐​professed textualists and originalists appear to accept, that the Constitution protects a right of access to contraception. Finally, many libertarians believe in what Professor Randy Barnett calls “the presumption of liberty,” which entails that the government bears the burden of explaining and justifying its use of force to constrain people’s freedom—and not merely with respect to the exercise of rights deemed “fundamental” by the Supreme Court, such as freedom of speech or religion. In short, most libertarians reject the idea that the Constitution only protects a discrete number of specifically identified rights, and instead understand the Constitution to protect a fairly broad—though admittedly finite and difficult to formulate with precision—set of rights, particularly including those with momentous implications for a person’s life, such as where to live, which career to pursue, whether and whom to marry, whether to have children, and how to raise them if so. What about the historical argument that an originalist interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment cannot support a right to abortion because, as the Dobbs opinion asserts, “when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy”? This is certainly a more sophisticated argument then the ipse dixit that the Constitution doesn’t use the word “abortion,” and it may indeed be persuasive evidence. But that history is still not conclusive on the constitutional question—at least not to us—because Cato scholars generally embrace the version of originalism based on original public meaning, not original intent. In other words, originalism is about interpreting words and phrases as they would have been understood at the time of adoption, not about the subjective intent of those who adopted them. And especially with respect to constitutional provisions written at a high level of generality, those approaches may well conflict. After all, the same Congress that adopted the Fourteenth Amendment also segregated public schools, and yet even Robert Bork acknowledged the correctness of Brown v. Board of Education on originalist grounds. As he wrote in The Tempting of America: Since equality and segregation were mutually inconsistent, though the ratifiers did not understand that, both could not be honored. When that is seen, it is obvious the Court must choose equality and prohibit state‐​imposed segregation. The purpose that brought the fourteenth amendment into being was equality before the law, and equality, not separation, was written into the law. It is thus unsurprising that the Fourteenth Amendment, properly understood, would lead to many conclusions unanticipated by its Framers, yet consistent with the original meaning of the broader principles that actually comprise the text they adopted. Cato, for example, filed multiple amicus briefs arguing that the text and original meaning of the Equal Protection Clause protect all people from arbitrary and invidious discrimination, and thus preclude states from limiting marriage to opposite‐​sex couples. The point of this discussion isn’t to suggest that the answer to such constitutional questions is straightforward or obvious; rather, it’s to illustrate that sophisticated originalism, at least with respect to those constitutional provisions written at a high level of generality, requires not just interpretation, but construction. In other words, just knowing the semantic meaning of say, the Privileges or Immunities Clause or the Equal Protection Clause isn’t enough to decide individual cases. You also need doctrinal rules that flesh out how to apply these broad principles in specific circumstances. Of course, even accepting this sophisticated understanding of originalism, there are still many valid grounds to criticize how the Court has constitutionalized abortion rights in particular. Unlike nearly all of the other “unenumerated rights” cases—such as Meyer v. Nebraska (raising and educating children), Griswold v. Connecticut (access to contraception), or Lawrence v. Texas (homosexual sex)—the right to obtain elective abortions involves not just the liberty of the person subject to state regulation, but also, at least arguably, the life and liberty of another person. And this is why the Dobbs opinion described the abortion right as “critically different from any other right that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of ‘liberty.’” Indeed, one of the most powerful objections to the reasoning in Roe itself is that, while the opinion asserted that the Court “need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins,” the Court was necessarily deciding that the state could not constitutionally protect the fetus for its own sake until the third trimester. Yet even conceding that the reasoning of Roe itself is quite muddled, the question today is complicated by the fact that a constitutional right to abortion access had been acknowledged and preserved for half a century. And while the Court has regularly reversed itself in the direction of expanding constitutional rights, it has rarely reversed itself in the opposite direction of revoking constitutional rights once protected. Indeed, the only other explicit example of that in the Court’s history is West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, which abandoned constitutional protection for the liberty of contract and labor previously acknowledged in Lochner v. New York and Adkins v. Children’s Hospital. That is not to say that rescinding protection for constitutional rights should be unthinkable, but rather that there should be an extraordinarily high bar for such a momentous act. The legal deficiencies of Roe and Casey may well be “obvious” to some, but there are some scholars and judges who see errors just as “obvious” in cases like Citizens United v. FEC (campaign finance), District of Columbia v. Heller (gun possession), or Janus v. AFSCME (compelled support of public employee unions). Proponents of reversing Roe and Casey should at least consider what a reversal might portend in future years, when the ideological makeup of the Court might be quite different. III. The Court’s process for identifying unenumerated rights that are entitled to meaningful judicial protection is un‐​originalist, ends‐​oriented, and deeply flawed Even assuming the Dobbs majority is correct in its ultimate conclusion—that the Constitution does not protect a general right to elective abortion—the opinion as written falls well short of answering that question with sufficient originalist rigor, because its analysis relies almost entirely on the “Glucksberg test” for assessing so‐​called “unenumerated rights.” Washington v. Glucksberg was a 1997 Supreme Court decision holding that there is no constitutional right to assisted suicide, in which the Court held that “substantive due process” protects only those fundamental liberties that are “objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” But the Dobbs majority offers little justification for this test itself, and there is ample reason to question it. First, Glucksberg concerns the doctrine of substantive due process, yet Dobbs all but ignores that the Privileges or Immunities Clause may be the more natural textual basis for protecting “unenumerated rights” than the Due Process Clause. In the Slaughter‐​House Cases in 1873, the Supreme Court effectively read the Privileges or Immunities Clause out of the Constitution, holding that this provision protects only those rights that “owe their existence to the Federal government,” such as the right to access federally navigable waterways and protection against piracy on the high seas. Thus, it excluded from protection anything that might be termed natural liberty, such as the rights to acquire and possess property, make contracts, pursue safety and happiness, along with all the liberties mentioned in the Bill of Rights. However, despite overwhelming consensus that this narrow interpretation is wrong, Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch are the only members of the current Court that have expressed interest in revisiting this grievous mistake. To be sure, the Dobbs majority dropped a footnote asserting that its conclusion would be the same under the Privileges or Immunities Clause, which would require the same “deeply rooted” analysis as Glucksberg. But that ipse dixit ignores the rich scholarship explaining how this long‐​ignored provision is best understood as requiring the state to demonstrate legitimate rationales when it restricts liberty. In other words, the Court entirely ignores the argument that the Privileges or Immunities Clause requires a “presumption of liberty.” Second, the Glucksberg test requires that a right be “carefully defined” before assessing whether it is “deeply rooted,” but there are different levels of generality at which a right can be defined. For example, the dispute in Bowers v. Hardwick—which upheld a state prohibition on “sodomy”—turned in part on whether the relevant right at issue was “a fundamental right [of] homosexuals to engage in sodomy” or the right of adults “to decide for themselves whether to engage in particular forms of private, consensual sexual activity.” One of these rights is much easier to characterize as “deeply rooted,” yet Glucksberg offers no real guidance on the “correct” way to frame such questions. This problem of generality‐​shifting is thus closely related to another major criticism of Glucksberg, which is that a narrow emphasis on rights that are “deeply rooted” has the inevitable effect of disfavoring rights that would specifically benefit historically marginalized groups. Similarly, consider the D.C. Circuit’s 2007 en banc decision Abigail Alliance v. Eschenbach, which ruled against terminally ill patients who wanted to use experimental drugs not yet approved by the FDA. The majority framed the relevant question as “whether terminally ill patients have a fundamental right to experimental drugs that have passed Phase I clinical testing.” Of course, given the relatively recent history of FDA regulation in this country, a right defined so narrowly would, nearly by definition, not be “deeply rooted.” Yet as the dissent explained, the “right to act to save one’s own life” absolutely was deeply rooted in our nation’s history. Assuming this was the appropriate level of generality, then the majority erred by “conflating the right with the deprivation.” Third, the Glucksberg test fails even to protect those fundamental rights that clearly are “deeply rooted” by any reasonable standard. The most obvious example here would be the right to pursue a lawful occupation, and thus to be free of occupational‐​licensing restrictions enacted solely for arbitrary or protectionist reasons. In the Slaughter‐​House Cases themselves, Justice Field explained in his dissent how “privileges or immunities” included “the right to pursue a lawful employment in a lawful manner, without other restraint than such as equally affects all persons.” Moreover, protecting this particular aspect of liberty—which had been so flagrantly denied to both slaves and freedmen—was a core motivation for passage of the Fourteenth Amendment itself. John Bingham, principal framer of the Fourteenth Amendment, wrote that its enactment would protect “the liberty … to work in an honest calling and contribute by your toil in some sort to the support of yourself, to the support of your fellowmen, and to be secure in the enjoyment of the fruits of your toil.” Nevertheless, at least since the infamous Williamson v. Lee Optical decision of 1955, the Supreme Court has given no meaningful protection to this fundamental right, declaring that occupational‐​licensing barriers are subject only to the “rational basis test”—which explicitly requires judges to ignore the actual reasons for restrictions on occupational freedom, and instead imagine possible rationales a legislature might have had. The utter failure of Glucksberg to check infringements on vocational liberty is the clearest indication that the test was never intended to be a principled doctrinal mechanism for identifying and protecting fundamental rights; rather, it is a results‐​oriented, endlessly manipulable artifice that allows judges to sidestep protecting fundamental rights entirely. Again, there are reasonable arguments that—even taking into account a more robust understanding of the Privileges or Immunities Clause and fundamental rights—the Fourteenth Amendment still doesn’t protect a general right to elective abortion. But as Professor Evan Bernick recently stated, it makes no sense to hail Dobbs as a “triumph of originalism” when the opinion “barely perceives an obligation to be originalist at all.” Conclusion In sum, reasonable minds—including reasonable libertarian minds—can disagree about the moral nature of abortion itself, the constitutional status of abortion rights, and the proper legal framework with which to evaluate asserted claims of a right to abortion access in particular circumstances. Likewise, critics of the Court’s abortion cases can reasonably disagree on the most principled way to address precedents whose reasoning arguably has not withstood the test of time. In the aftermath of Dobbs, some states may well attempt to regulate abortion in ways that do pose grave concerns for libertarians generally and Cato specifically, not because of abortion itself but because of more general constitutional principles. For example, many states are pursuing plans not just to prohibit abortion within their own borders, but also to punish residents who cross state lines to receive an abortion in a state where its legal. Similarly, if Congress attempted to either prohibit abortion or enshrine abortions rights nationwide, that would inevitably raise questions about whether such acts are within the scope of Congress’s enumerated powers at all. If and when such questions arise, Cato will not hesitate to advance the principles of federalism and limited government that we always have. But as to the issues in Dobbs itself, we don’t believe these questions have an answer so obvious or uncontroversial that principle demands adopting an institutional position that will undoubtedly be at odds with the legal judgment of one group or another of our respected colleagues.",

                    Body = "Libertarians defend a minimal state that is only allowed to raise taxes in order to secure and enforce individual rights. Any redistributive aim is regarded as illegitimate. Therefore, it is not common to apply a libertarian political theory to justify policies to mitigate or adapt to climate change, since they require large-scale redistribution and taxation. Nevertheless, my aim in this chapter is to outline a libertarian framework for reflecting on the moral problem of human-caused climate change. I distinguish between two potential libertarian arguments. First, climate change can be said to threaten many rights of currently living and future individuals. The libertarian argument of rights- infringements defends governmental actions to prevent and to exact compensation for conduct that leads to a violation of individual rights. I discuss the conditions under which this line of reasoning justifies governmental actions to mitigate climate change. I conclude, however, that the argument is based on highly restrictive assumptions. Second, the use of the atmosphere can be considered an appropriation of a commonly owned resource. Applying a Lockean theory of just appropriation, libertarianism allows for climate action by showing that the excessive use of the atmosphere is unjust. Therefore, there is a case for justified redistribution. I defend this latter argument as more promising alternative to justify duties of climate change prevention. I will outline the normative implications by distinguishing them from those of more common accounts to climate justice. Introduction Commonly, libertarians are defendants of a minimal state that is only allowed to impose taxes in order to secure basic rights from interference. The primary purpose of the state is to protect and enforce strong property rights. Any redistributive aim, e.g., social insurance or the provision of public goods is considered illegitimate. The outcome of free markets based on decentralized, voluntary interactions is defended as a just allocation of income and capital among members of society. Yet, the transition from a fossil-fuel-based economy to a carbon-neutral economy cannot be achieved without enormous governmental investments in infrastructure, subsidies of sustainable energy use, and legal interventions in the free market, such as taxes, regulations and prohibitions. Thus, a libertarian political theory seems incapable of justifying policies to combat climate change. As I will show, however, libertarian political philosophy does provide a highly interesting approach to thinking about the problem of climate change. It has two potential arguments that may support climate action. The first argument is based on an understanding of excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the causation of global warming as a transgression of rights (Zwolinski 2014; Torpman 2021). The rights of those negatively affected by climate change are violated by those who emit too much. According to libertarian thought, rights-encroachments can only be justified if rights-holders consent to them. However, climate change leads to severe rights-violations of individuals who cannot possibly consent – such as children and future generations. Thus, a libertarian might argue that polluters have a duty to either drastically reduce emissions or to pay compensation for their rights- infringements. The second argument draws on the idea of justified acquisition of property, which is a core element of any libertarian defence of strong property rights. Libertarians often refer to John Locke’s (1980, chap. V) account of just appropriation, which maintains that property is generated not only by the use of one’s labour and just transfer, but also the use and acquisition of external goods that, originally, do not belong to any individual. Worldly resources, Locke assumes, belong to everyone alike. He therefore introduces restrictions to the legitimate appropriation of these resources (the so-called ‘provisos’). People, he concedes, are only allowed to use resources up to a point at which there is still ‘enough, and as good, left’ for others to use. Now, climate change can be construed as a problem of unjust acquisition of property. The atmosphere can be considered a finite resource and the current overuse of it as a sink does not seem to leave ‘enough, or as good’ for our children and future generations. Therefore, the Lockean proviso provides a powerful argument for the restriction of the use of the atmosphere and for duties of climate change mitigation. Because libertarianism may conceptualize climate change as a problem of illegitimate property and because it asks the question of historically unjust use of commonly owned worldly resources it offers a unique rights-based account on climate justice that allocates duties of omission and of compensation according to legitimate claims. In this chapter, my aim is to elucidate and discuss these two arguments and to outline the conditions under which libertarianism accepts restrictions on individual liberties and property in order to combat climate change. I argue that, to justify duties of climate change mitigation, the second argument is more promising than the first. The next section introduces the libertarian argument of individual rights- infringements and critically reflects its assumptions and implications. The third section distinguishes different possible views on just acquisition of natural resources according to the Lockean proviso. I introduce Robert Nozick’s (1974, 167–174) ‘weak interpretation’ of the proviso and contrast it with stronger versions, such as left-libertarian accounts (Steiner 1994, 234–236; Otsuka 1998; Vallenthyne 2007). Depending on the strength of the interpretation of the proviso, different normative conclusions can be drawn from the libertarian account. Furthermore, I compare the implications of the libertarian argument from unjust acquisition of property with common accounts of climate justice. The last section outlines some conclusions. 1.  The Argument of Rights-Infringement Although most libertarians are against redistribution, they do not oppose the existence of the state as such. A minimal state that secures individuals’ rights to life, liberty and property is generally accepted as justified (Brennan 2012, 57–59). Justified governmental institutions can restrict rights-infringements by means of a system of sanctions, law enforcement, and legal courts. If individual rights are infringed upon, the state determines the amount of compensation, exacts it from the wrongdoers and allocates it to the victims. Climate change can be said to threaten some of the most fundamental rights of individuals. Natural catastrophes threaten lives, water scarcity causes severe health problems, and sea-level rise and desertification force people to migrate (IPCC 2021, 15–31). Herein lies the libertarian argument for climate action (Singer 2004, ch. 2). Causing climate change can be seen as an act of illegitimate rights-infringement and the perpetrators should either be prohibited from causing it or owe compensation to affected individuals. A few clarifications are required to understand this argument. First, the responsibility for climate change is different from paradigm cases of rights- infringements, such as theft, bodily injuries and homicide. Not every CO2– emitting activity ultimately results in the violation of other people’s rights. The concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere can cause a problem to humans only if emission levels exceed the earth’s absorptive capacity. And even if that is the case, the overuse of the atmosphere could still be so small that humans have enough time to adapt without having their life, health or liberty threatened. It is, therefore, wrong to think about the problem in terms of categorical prohibitions (as with theft or killing). But I will come to that later. Second, an individual’s action alone cannot be said to effectuate a rights- infringement. Climate change is an outcome of collective action – the aggregate of a large number of individual excess emissions. Nevertheless, even if through ‘miniscule’ and ‘imperceptible’ actions, individuals cause harm to other people by causing global warming (Broome 2012, 56). The low magnitude of one’s contribution does not preclude legitimate restrictions on her actions (Vallentyne and van der Vossen 2014, Sect. 3; cf. Railton 2003, 191). Third, rights-infringements do not necessarily occur even if CO2 emissions exceed some critical level. Environmental problems may occur in one way or another. There is no certainty as to how people will be affected by climate change or even whether they will be affected at all. Thus, the joint causation of an increase in global temperatures is not necessarily a direct violation of rights. It is an imposition of risk upon those potentially affected (cf. Nozick 1974, 73–77; Railton 2003, 193). The negative effect of risk can be conceptualized as a so-called ‘expectation value’ – the negative value of an outcome multiplied by the probability of its incidence. The worse the outcome and/or the higher the probability, the greater the harm for the individual. Even if bad outcomes do not ultimately occur, imposing risk is an action that libertarians agree must be prohibited or compensated for (e.g., Shahar 2009, 228). Let me show this with an example. If a person is speeding, she is unjustifiably increasing the risk of harm to other road users. Even if the potential harm does not materialise, driving too fast has a negative effect on other individuals. They enjoy fewer freedoms because they have to be more careful on the road, or they have to pay more to insure themselves against harm. Thus, risk has an undesired effect on the potential enjoyment of individual rights. Libertarian approaches consider this negative effect an unjustified curtailment of rights and, thus (under certain circumstances) a prohibition of the risk-increasing action as justified (Nozick 1974, 65–71, 73– 74). Duties of Compensation or Duties of Prevention? What exactly does the argument of rights-infringement justify? Which governmental actions are justified to combat climate change? To answer these questions, we need to understand the libertarian argument for the state. As mentioned above, libertarians regard a minimal state as justified to secure individual rights. The first five chapters of Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State and Utopia outline why and how people would hypothetically consent to a centralised institution that restricts conduct that violates or endangers individual rights and that implements legal procedures to exact compensation in cases of rights-infringement. The starting point of the argument is a conception of a state of nature in which people find themselves without governmental institutions. Individuals in the state of nature, Nozick assumes, possess rights to life, liberty, physical integrity and property. However, since some people would frequently infringe upon the rights of others, people face a constant risk. Individuals are, therefore, ready to partially abandon some of their rights and authorise a state to take measures to protect and enforce some of their other rights. Nozick and other libertarians thus assume that individuals would hypothetically consent to restrictions on their liberties and the authorisation of a minimal state. A similar hypothetical history can be imagined in order to justify restrictions on CO2 emissions. Present and future individuals hold rights that might potentially be infringed upon as a result of climate change. This expectation leads them to accept taxes, laws, and regulations in order to protect their rights in the future. Policies to prevent or adapt to climate change can be justified if individuals are willing to abandon some of their rights in order to reduce the risk of being killed or suffering severe impairments to their health and property. However, Nozick (1974, 58–59, 71–73) and other libertarians would not argue that every rights-infringement justifies a prohibition of certain conduct. Rights can be protected either with prohibitions or with compensation for their violation. For example, if a person cannot or will not fulfil her contractual obligations, then she usually owes damages to the infringed party. Breach of contract is not prohibited, but the loss must be compensated. If rights- infringements can also be compensated for, one must ask, why ever prohibit conduct? In the context of climate ethics, this question translates into the question of how we should react to the challenges of climate change: should high-emitting countries set up funds to cover adaptation costs (i.e., compensate) or should they reduce CO2 emissions and thus increase our effort to mitigate global warming (i.e., prohibit) or both? Libertarians can easily argue for compensation for risks imposed on those potentially affected by climate change – that is compensation for the negative expectation value. Every person’s excessive emissions increase the likelihood of people suffering from global warming. Within a country whose carbon footprint is above a sustainable level, everyone is partly responsible for increased risk. The state could, therefore, exact compensation for that risk from all excessively emitting individuals by taxing them. The raised funds in turn would be used to cover the adaptation costs of present and future people who are negatively affected by climate change. It should be noted, however, that such a tax is not justified with reference to distributive justice. The redistribution that results from a duty of compensation does not infringe strong property rights. Rather it is a rectificatory means to reinstall justice in reaction to a prior injustice. Thus, there is a libertarian argument in favour of compensatory measures to cover adaption costs that is compatible with the libertarian rejection of distributive justice. With regard to climate change mitigation, however, the libertarian argument is more intricate. Intergenerational Compensation for Prevention Nozick is concerned with the question of how a minimal state can be justified given that it restricts certain conduct. Some individuals, he admits, do not benefit from such restrictions (such as mitigation efforts) and, therefore, in a hypothetical state of nature, would be unwilling to subject to a legal system that restricts their liberties. He asks why these people would accept being restricted by the state (Nozick 1974, 51) and he introduces what he calls a ‘principle of compensation’ (Nozick 1974, 78): individuals that do not benefit from being subjected to restrictions should be compensated for the restriction of their liberties. This principle does not apply to cases of classical rights-infringements. Everybody can be assumed to benefit from the restriction of theft, violence, and killing since all members of society are potential victims. Presumably everyone would voluntarily subject herself to the legal system that restricts this conduct and would restrain herself from engaging in it, without claiming amends. However, not all risks of rights-violations apply to all equally. A state that prevents excessive emissions only benefits some while others carry the burden without ever being at risk of suffering from hazardous effects of climate change. In order to ensure anonymous, hypothetical consent, libertarians therefore need to argue for a principle of compensation for those who are not at risk but nevertheless urged to reduce emissions. The major difference in the risk distribution exists between the living people and the future generations. The latter face far greater risks of severe impairments on their quality of life. Thus, reducing CO2 emissions benefits them more than present generations. Moreover, measures to prevent climate change must be taken now. So, the costs of reducing emissions are borne by individuals in the present. From this perspective, living people would most probably agree to prevent climate change only if they were compensated for their costs of doing so since they only benefit little and bear all the costs. At first glance, this line of thought seems to run contrary to any conception of climate justice. It seems to imply that we are allowed to charge the potential victims for the omission of our wrongdoing. Intuitively, it is not future people who owe something to us. Rather, we owe them. Nevertheless, a highly interesting proposal made by John Broome (2012, 43–48) goes in the same direction. It is not based on reflections of justice, but rather applies efficiency as a normative standard. He argues that an efficient hypothetical bargain between present and future people would result in the commitment to emissions reduction policies (cf. Posner and Sunstein 2008, 169–70). But he maintains that the future people would have to compensate us by paying public debts our generation has to take on to finance the restructuring of the economy. Broome argues for the legitimacy of charging future generations with the costs of mitigation with pragmatic reasons. In a state of crisis, we should not ‘encumber the task of fixing climate change with the much broader task of improving the distribution of resource’ (Broome 2012, 47). However, for libertarians, compensation is not something that is instrumentally reasonable. It is something that is indeed required by justice. This libertarian proposal of an ‘intergenerational contract’ based on a Nozickian principle of compensation might be appropriate from the perspective of rectificatory justice, but it would have dramatic consequences from the perspective of distributive justice. An imbalance of burdens and benefits (risk reduction) of climate action exists not only between generations, but also between different countries. Certain states are fortunate to be relatively unaffected by the negative consequences of climate change, whereas for others it will have a catastrophic impact. As a matter of fact, wealthy regions of the world, such as the United States, will be less affected by climate change, while poorer countries, such as India, will be affected significantly (Sunstein 2007, 10–17). The libertarian proposal would thus imply that the poor compensate the rich for preventing climate change. Hence, the libertarian argument for climate change mitigation yields distributive consequences that few scholars in climate ethics would be willing to accept. The argument, therefore, leads to a reductio ad absurdum. But not only are the conclusions of the argument susceptible to criticism. There are also critical assumptions behind it. Critical Assumptions behind the Argument To justify climate action either as prevention of or compensation for rights- infringements only allows for very little governmental interference if it is assumed that future people cannot possess rights. The hazardous effects of climate change, such as sea-level rise, desertification and natural catastrophes will, of course, affect living people. But the true extent of the crisis, with all its detrimental effects to quality of life, will mostly affect future generations. In order to be a viable argument in climate ethics, the rights- based libertarian claim therefore needs to assume that future human beings have claims vis-à-vis present people to prevent or compensate for the harm caused by excessive emissions. The assumption that future people possess rights, however, is restrictive and philosophically challenging. First, it is restrictive in the sense that it excludes a conception of rights that is defended by adherents of the ‘will theory of rights’ (Hart 1982, 183–185; Steiner 1994, 55–107). According to this conception, a rights-holder is necessarily vested with control over enforcement, the possibility of waiving the right and forgoing a claim to compensation in the case of rights-violations. Thus, rights grant the individuals moral and legal powers to exercise their will. Yet, future people cannot possibly possess powers to demand enforcement or waive their rights. Therefore, a will theorist cannot, without contradiction, conceive of future people holding rights (Steiner 1994, 249–261). In particular, with respect to the powers of waiver, libertarians are usually sympathetic with the will theory of rights (e.g., Steiner 1994). Their non- paternalistic stance is supported by a conception of rights that ensures the possibility of a rights-holder’s consent to encroachments (cf. Nozick 1974, 58). I do not believe that libertarians are necessarily committed to a will theory of rights (Steiner and Vallentyne 2009, 57). The rights of future people might also be conceptualised within an ‘interest theory’ (Lyons 1969, 176; Raz 1986, 165–186; Kramer 1998, 60–100) that conceives of the core function of rights as the protection of individual interests, such as satisfaction of needs, attainment of well-being or development of capabilities. Nevertheless, the assumption of rights of future people is restrictive in that it excludes certain ideas of the notion of rights. Second, the assumption that future people possess rights is philosophically challenging because harms created by excessive GHG emissions are not imposed on a specific individual. The actions we take today, may influence whether future people exist or not. Also, the actions we take today may have an effect on the circumstances under which future people will grow up and live and therefore may have an impact on people’s identities. Lastly, they may have an effect on the number of people that will live in the future. If we decide not to reduce GHG emissions today, this changes the way people will live in the future. The people living in a world that is significantly warmer would not be the same people as those living in a world that has more or less the same temperature as ours. Hence, we cannot say that we made someone in particular worse off (than that person would have been otherwise). This problem is discussed under the term ‘non-identity problem’ (Parfit 1984, 351– 377). Concerning the question of whether excessive CO2 emissions violate the rights of future people, the non-identity problem is significant. In a ‘strict sense’, rights imply duties directed to specific rights-holders (Hohfeld 2001, 13). If the duties to prevent climate change constitute rights in the strict sense, they need to be owed to a particular person or group of people. In the case of actions affecting future people, however, a person’s compliance or non-compliance with a duty might make the right holder non-existent. The libertarian argument therefore has to abandon this strong ‘person-affecting’ conception of rights-infringements (Meyer 2021, Sect. 2). Actions that constitute a transgression do not cause a specific person to have her rights infringed upon. In a future that occurs when we take no climate action, there would be no person that could possibly claim she would have her rights better realized if previous generations had taken climate action. But if no person is worse off than she would have been otherwise, how can this constitute a rights-infringement? One possible answer is to introduce a certain threshold of well-being, such as, for example, some basic needs that must be satisfied (Meyer 2003, 147–149). Whenever a person is born and finds herself below that level, her rights are infringed upon. Thus, those living today must ensure that people born in the future will not be worse off than they ought to be according to a critical threshold. Now, both of these conceptual understandings of rights are themselves not uncontroversial and require further investigation, which I cannot accomplish within the scope of this chapter. It should be noted that the exclusion of particular theories of rights as well as the weak person-affecting conception of rights-infringements render the libertarian argument less ‘robust’. On the one hand, libertarians who do not accept either of these assumptions might conclude that the only thing that needs to be prevented or compensated for are the hazardous effects of climate change on living people. With this restriction in mind, the problem of climate change as rights-infringement is similar to a case of, for example, air pollution (Rothbard 1973, 301–321; Nozick 1974, 77). But the moral challenge of climate change is not sufficiently described as a problem between contemporaries. Action is required to secure the liveability of the planet for future generations. On the other hand, non- libertarians who are not convinced that the libertarian account can accept either of these two implications, tend to refrain from endorsing a libertarian account of climate ethics altogether. Thus, the argument so far is based on a weak footing. In the next section, I discuss a more promising approach to justifying climate action from a libertarian perspective. 2.  The Argument of Unjust Appropriation Libertarianism places a strong emphasis on the moral significance of property rights. In principle, the state and society have no authority to take away and redistribute something an individual has rightfully acquired, were it for social welfare, health insurance, pension funds or the provision of public goods – except, of course, for the maintenance of a minimal state; e.g., law enforcement institutions and courts. Nozick’s (1974, 151) ‘entitlement theory of justice’ captures this core idea: If a person acquires property either through her own labour or through voluntary transaction, she is entitled to dispose of it. Others (the state included) have no claim to deprive her of this property. Redistribution is justified only when either property was unjustly acquired, or transactions were coercive or involuntary.",

Today, however, our country is among the most extreme examples of industrialized nations that have a widening gap between the wealthy and the rest of its citizenry — the working poor, the struggling middle class, and those who increasingly cannot make ends meet. Our public schools, from kindergarten through college, are forced to cut back countless programs and services. Fees for community colleges are up sharply, and many public universities must turn away qualified students. More than 50 million Americans have no medical insurance coverage. The crisis in publicly subsidized housing is intensifying, while publicly funded \"corporate welfare\" continues unabated. Our tax code favors the wealthy. Our criminal justice system assigns long prison terms to hundreds of thousands of perpetrators of victimless crimes, such as selling marijuana. Our civil liberties of privacy and free speech are impaired by the excesses of the USA PATRIOT Act and kindred new laws that use a national tragedy (the attacks on September 11, 2001) as an excuse to impose ubiquitous surveillance and control over citizens. In addition, discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or race continues to sap the potential of our society and to violate personal dignity. Feelings of isolation and helplessness are common in America today. Children are increasingly shaped by an \"electronic childhood\" with little direct experience of nature and free play. Our families are scattered, our popular culture is crassly manipulated by the profit motives of increasingly concentrated media conglomerates, and our sense of community is a pale shadow of what earlier generations of Americans knew. The Green Party strongly believes that quality of life is determined not only by material aspects that can be measured and counted, but also by elements that cannot be quantified. We firmly support the separation of church and state, but we also acknowledge the spiritual dimension of life, and we honor the cultivation of various types of spiritual experience in our diverse society. We believe that artistic expression and a thriving structure of art institutions are key to community well-being. We believe that a deep and broad embrace of nonviolence is the only effective way to stop cycles of violence, from the home to the streets to the international level. We advocate a diverse system of education that would introduce children early to the wonders of the Great School (Nature), and would cultivate the wisdom of eco-education, eco-economics, eco-politics, and eco-culture. We seek to protect our children from the corrosive effects of mass culture that trains them to regard themselves first and foremost as consumers. We support the shift in modern medicine to include healing through complementary therapies and engagement with the Great Hospital (Nature).

                    Body = "Those on the political left in the US and UK are more likely than those on the right to notice social inequality, but only when it affects typically disadvantaged groups. This is according to new research from The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), Northwestern University, the University of Exeter and the University of Michigan, published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Disagreement about whether some groups face more unequal outcomes and treatment is common in public discussions. For example, debates about the balance between men and women on TV shows often produce polarised reactions. The researchers for this study sought to analyse where these different perceptions come from. Egalitarians and non-egalitarians\r\nThe study’s authors considered two relevant groups across ideological lines: egalitarians, those who believe that groups in society should be equal; and anti-egalitarians, those who are more tolerant of inequality between groups. The researchers found that these ideological beliefs influence whether people detect disparities between groups in a range of settings. In one experiment, participants from the US and UK were shown photographs of everyday urban scenes and asked to report what they noticed. Some of the images contained cues related to inequality, for example, depicting both a luxury car and a homeless person in the same scene. Egalitarians were more likely to naturally remark on inequalities in the image, while anti-egalitarians were more likely to remark on other aspects. In other experiments the researchers directly manipulated whether inequality harmed typically advantaged or disadvantaged groups. For example, participants were asked to view the CVs of applicants to an organisation that had just completed their hiring process and learned whether or not the applicants were hired. There were two conditions of the task: the organisation was biased against applicants from ethnic minorities, or the organisation was biased against white applicants. Attention to inequality applied selectively\r\n“We found that when there was bias against racial minorities, egalitarians were more likely to notice it than anti-egalitarians. In contrast, when there was bias against white applicants, egalitarians were no more or less likely to notice it than anti-egalitarians,” said Hannah Waldfogel, a doctoral student at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, and a co-corresponding author on the study. “Our results suggest that egalitarians are not more likely than anti-egalitarians to notice all forms of inequality, but rather that egalitarians’ heightened attention to inequality applies selectively to instances where inequality harms typically disadvantaged groups,” Waldfogel added. Existing research suggests people process information in ways that are consistent with their pre-existing beliefs, but this research indicates pre-existing beliefs about the desirability of group equality shape what people notice around them in the first place. Different social worlds\r\nDr Jennifer Sheehy-Skeffington, research co-author and Assistant Professor of Social Psychology at LSE, explains, “Our research suggests there is an ideological bias in visual attention: those on the political left actually see more inequality in the world around them than those on the political right, though they are only more likely to notice inequality that harms typically disadvantaged groups. “This helps shed light on why we have such wide political disagreements about inequality. Those on the left are frustrated that others don’t acknowledge inequalities they see, and those on the right claim egalitarians are playing up inequalities that don’t exist. “That ideological preferences shape such basic visual processes, even unconsciously, implies that those on the left and the right aren’t just fighting for different social worlds; they are living in different social worlds to begin with.”",

We believe that all business has a social contract with society and the environment — in effect a fiduciary responsibility — and that the concepts of socially responsible business and shareholder democracy can be models for prospering, successful business. \r\nWe call for an economic system that is based on a combination of private businesses, decentralized democratic cooperatives, publicly owned enterprises, and alternative economic structures. Collectively, this system puts human and ecological needs alongside profits to measure success, and maintains accountability to communities. Community-based economics constitutes an alternative to both corporate capitalism and state socialism. It values diversity and decentralization. Recognition of limits is central to this system. The drive to accumulate power and wealth is a pernicious characteristic of a civilization headed in a pathological direction. Greens advocate that economic relations become more direct, more cooperative, and more egalitarian. Humanizing economic relations is just one aspect of our broader objective: to shift toward a different way of life characterized by sustainability, regionalization, more harmonious balance between the natural ecosphere and the human-made technosphere, and revival of community life. Our perspective is antithetical to both Big Business and Big Government. Greens support a major redesign of commerce. We endorse true-cost pricing. [See section E.1. True Cost Pricing] We support production methods that eliminate waste. In natural systems, everything is a meal for something else. Everything recycles, there is no waste. We need to mimic natural systems in the way we manufacture and produce things. Consumables need to be designed to be thrown into a compost heap and/or eaten. Durable goods would be designed in closed-loop systems, ultimately to be disassembled and reassembled. Toxics would be safeguarded, minimally produced, secured, and would ideally have markers identifying them in perpetuity with their makers. The Green Party opposes capitalism and seeks to build an alternative economic system based on social ecology, decentralization of power, and freedom from state control. We will build an eco-socialist economy based on large-scale green public works, municipalization, and workplace and community democracy. Worker and community empowerment will ensure that decisions that greatly affect our lives are made in the interests of our communities, not at the whim of capitalist CEOs and distant boards of directors. Democratically run enterprises embedded in and accountable to our communities will make more ecologically sound decisions and help end labor exploitation, environmental exploitation, and racial, gender, and wealth inequality and bring about economic and social justice. Greens view the economy as a part of the ecosystem, not as an isolated subset in which nothing but resources come in and products and waste go out. There is a fundamental conflict between economic growth and environmental protection. There is an absolute limit to economic growth based on laws of thermodynamics and principles of ecology. Long before that limit is reached, an optimum size of the economy is reached which maximizes human welfare in an holistic sense. We support a Superfund for Workers program as envisioned by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union in 1991. Such a program would guarantee full income and benefits for all workers displaced by ecological conversion until they find new jobs with comparable income and benefits. The Green Party supports methods, such as the Index of Social Health Indicators, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, and the Genuine Progress Indicator, that take into account statistics on housing, income, and nutrition.",

                    Body = "A basic economic principle is that any policy that is good for society as a whole can be made to be good for everyone in society, even if the policy creates winners and losers. It requires only that the winners be taxed just a bit to compensate the losers—and everyone is better off. Economists use powerful tools to clarify which economic policies are best for society. So why should economic policy be controversial? A basic political economy principle is that the winners don’t like being taxed to compensate losers. And the battle is joined, not over what is best for society but rather over who will be the winners and losers. What is best for the country may not be best for my region, or group, or industry, or class—and so I will fight it. Even in democracies, plenty of citizens might agree that politics obeys the golden rule: those with the gold make the rules. Special-interest groups do seem to play an outsize role around the world, democratic or not. These include wealthy individuals, powerful industries, big banks and corporations, and formidable labor unions. How else to explain why Americans pay two or three times the world price for sugar? There are a handful of sugarcane plantations and a few thousand sugar beet farmers in the United States—and 330 million sugar consumers. You’d think that the 330 million would count for a lot more in politics than the several thousand, but you’d be wrong. For decades, subsidies and trade barriers have raised the price of sugar to the benefit of the sugar planters and farmers and to the detriment of everyone else. Why does a tiny group of sugar producers matter more than the rest of the country? A commonplace of political economy is that concentrated interests usually win over diffuse interests. The sugar producers are well organized and work hard to influence politicians. If they didn’t get favorable government treatment they’d go out of business, so it’s important for them to organize to lobby and fund politicians. The cost to consumers is estimated at $2 billion to $3 billion a year. That’s a lot of money—but it comes to a couple of cents a day for the average American. No consumer is going to talk to an elected representative or threaten to vote for an opponent over a couple of cents a day. The fact that producers are concentrated while consumers are diffuse helps explain trade protection. A few automobile manufacturers can organize themselves; tens of millions of car buyers can’t. That’s not all. Management and labor in the auto industry may not agree on much, but automakers and autoworkers agree that they want to be protected from foreign competition. Politicians—especially politicians from areas where automobile manufacturing is important—have a hard time denying a common demand of workers and owners in a powerful industry. Perhaps this is not such a bad thing. Sugar farmers and autoworkers depend for their livelihood on supportive policies. Who is to say that their jobs are less important than lower prices for consumers? There is no simple, widely accepted way to balance the benefits against the costs—is cheaper sugar important enough to bankrupt thousands of hardworking farmers? Politics is, in fact, the way society adjudicates among conflicting interests, and maybe those with more at stake should have a bigger say. Political economists don’t usually take stands on complicated moral and ethical issues of this sort. They try to understand why societies choose to do what they do. The fact that sugar or car producers have much more at stake and are much better organized than sugar or car consumers helps explain why government policies favor sugar and car producers over consumers. Some consumers are concentrated, though. Sugar is sweet, and the corporations of the Sweetener Users Association want it to be cheap as well. Coca-Cola, Hershey, and the like have pushed hard to change American sugar policy. The fact that there are powerful concentrated interests on both sides of the issue helps explain why prices aren’t even higher than they are. The same thing is true of industrial products. Steelmakers want protection; steel users—like the auto manufacturers—don’t. Trade policy is not just a battle between big corporations and disunited households; it’s also a battle among big corporations. Otherwise we’d expect every industry to be protected and trade to be tightly limited everywhere. In fact, there are plenty of powerful interests in favor of international trade and investment. The world’s multinational corporations and international banks depend on an open flow of goods and capital. This is especially the case today, when many of the world’s largest companies depend on complex global supply chains. A typical international corporation today produces parts and components in dozens of countries, assembles them in dozens more, and sells the final products everywhere. Trade barriers interfere with these supply chains, which is why most of the world’s biggest companies are also some of the biggest supporters of freer trade. ",
